Making Innovation Happen \n \nWith demands on the NHS increasing all the time, now more than ever innovation is \ncritical to delivering both changes in clinical practice and advances in the latest \ntechnology. Furthermore high quality care has to be maintained but it needs to be \ndelivered at a lower cost. To achieve this, system wide uptake of innovation is \nrequired, even if this is disruptive to existing clinical practice. This submission \nproposes an innovation architecture that will help make innovation happen. \n \nCurrent State of MedTech Innovation \n \nThe current state of Medtech innovation characterises some of the wider challenges \nassociated with innovation in the health sector. Despite the NHS being the largest \nhealthcare employer in the world, it has not used its dominant market position to \ndrive forward the innovations it needs from industry or gained the clinical/financial \nand user benefits that a major customer would expect. Of course, some of the \nelements for transforming the innovation landscape are already in place and a range \nof existing initiatives are addressing some of these challenges. However, several \nunderlying weaknesses remain: \n? a failure to systematically identify and address both inhibitors and \naccelerators of innovation particularly those at grass roots level; \n? an innovation and IP system that does not embrace ?open innovation? models; \n? a structure that is siloed both at local and national levels, with groups driving \ntheir own cost reduction and innovation agendas \n? an imbalance in how the innovation process is understood, managed and \ndriven ? with this influenced by too many top down initiatives and not enough \nby commercial,  user/consumer, academic and industry perspectives;  \n? overall a lack of translational infrastructure to facilitate the whole innovation \nprocess in Medtech. There is an absence of a single initiative that pulls some \nof these elements together, but which has been considered within other \nsectors following the Hauser and Dyson reports.  \n  \nARU and the PMI - a Partnership for Change \n \nAnglia Ruskin University (ARU) has established the Postgraduate Medical Institute \n(PMI), a partnership between healthcare providers and the university sector based on \nthe principle of facilitating local, grass root clinical and academic excellence. This \nbottom-up/pull approach supports three key strands of the PMI which are \npostgraduate medical education, research and innovation. In medical innovation ARU \nand its partners are now working up a venture which would address some of these \nweaknesses ? through a MedTech campus model. This is designed to catalyse the \nMedTech innovation process, through a bottom up partnership with industry, the \nuniversity, NHS, customers, government, NGO?s and Citizens.  \n \nThe MedTech campus will be private sector led, adopting an open innovation model, \nwith a near market/commercial focus from the outset. It will provide the translational \ninfrastructure necessary to deliver large scale transformation of MedTech innovation.   \n \nSome Suggested Actions  \n \n? Identify accelerators of innovation and facilitate these.  \n? Make innovation part of the NHS system architecture at a local level and \nprovide grass roots support/empowerment to deliver innovation \n? Develop a national network of translational infrastructure to deliver rapid, \nscalable system wide MedTech innovation. This must be a private ?public led \napproach and ensure that DoH and BIS thinking on this is joint and that major \nbuy- in is secured from the private sector. The Challenge ? Making Innovation Happen \n \nThe current rate of increase in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP cannot \nbe maintained in the long run. Consequently healthcare systems will have to deliver \nhigh quality care for less. This will have to be achieved through system wide adoption \nof innovation. \n \nOne of the key challenges will be to get widespread uptake of innovations by \nclinicians, even when that involves changes to clinical practice. There is no choice; \nwe have to make innovation happen. This submission describes the current \nMedTech landscape in the UK and suggests actions that can help deliver system \nwide transformation.  \n \nCurrent state of MedTech Innovation in the NHS and UK \n \nMedical device developers in the public and private sectors continue to \npredominantly use a closed innovation model rather than ?open innovation? which is \nbeing embraced by many other industry sectors, for example IBM has recently made \n$3bn from opening up their patent book. This ?innovation in isolation? approach has \nbeen common practice for many years, but now more and more is recognised as \nhaving a diminishing role to play. The persistence of this approach is in part due to \nrestrictive IP policies in both commercial and public sectors. If innovation is going to \ntransform the medical device development sector the status quo is not sustainable. \n \nThe UK has not sufficiently capitalised on its strengths for medical device \ndevelopment and commercialisation; it has the largest single healthcare employer in \nthe world and the second largest science capability, second only to the US. This \nfailure is in part down to the critical gap between its clinical experience/research \nfindings and the development of these into commercial propositions that can attract \nfinancing. \n \nThe UK medical device market is estimated to be worth ?10bn per year with over \n80% of products being manufactured abroad. The NHS is the main MedTech \ncustomer in the UK, but has not significantly used this dominant position to drive \nforward the innovations it needs from industry or gained the potential clinical, \nfinancial and user benefits that such a major customer should expect from this level \nof market share/power. \n \nPrevious top down approaches have delivered some successful device \ndevelopments, but these remain small scale and have not achieved widespread \nadoption. Key reasons for this failure include lack of commercialisation skills, \ninadequate incentives to deliver, lack of clear alternatives other than bank/VC \nmarket/business angels ? which are often difficult to access and no single focus in \nthe UK where all the necessary infrastructure, equipment, skills and partners are in \nplace to facilitate the innovation process. \n \nIn addition to this there are several issues facing the MedTech sector in the UK \nwhich place it at a disadvantage to other countries: \n \n1) Lack of appropriate structure/management of deals to allow private investment \nfunds to engage in a similar manner to that seen on the west coast of the USA, \nwhere deals typically go through seed corn / development / first / second round \nfunding ensuring that the right management is in place to carry it and the right levels \nof equity are retained for the investors. \n2) Unnecessary bureaucracy. For example the criteria for Investors claiming EIS \nrelief on Investments into SME?s can be limiting ? e.g. number of employees limited \nto 50 at the point of investment. 3) Lack of leading edge tax incentives. For example Southern Ireland offers a patent \nincome tax exemption up to ?5M, a stamp duty exemption for IP, R&D tax credits \n20% non-capital, 100% capital, a corporation tax rate of 12.5% and qualifying R&D \ncan take place in any EU member state. \n \nTo date the NHS has focused on a top down/push public sector approach to \naccelerating adoption and diffusion of innovation. This has met with some success, \nbut not on the kind of scale that will have a significant impact across the healthcare \nsystem. Surprisingly there has been no national private sector led/facilitated \napproach to transforming innovation in the NHS. \n \nWith the changes proposed in the Health and Social Care Bill 2011, NHS clinical and \ninnovation architecture will change. GP commissioning groups, supported by the \nNational Commissioning Board are likely to act as local innovation hubs. This will \nbring a local cultural/structural support for innovation for the first time in many parts of \nthe NHS. The challenge now is to capitalise on the new paradigm of grass roots \ninnovation empowerment provided by the Bill.  \n \n \nInhibitors and Catalysts of Innovation in the NHS \n \nMany thousands of books, research papers and presentations have looked at the \nbarriers to innovation in the health sector, but identification of these inhibitors has not \ndelivered the transformation in innovation that might have been expected from such a \nbody of work.   \n \nNHS and academic staff are not only skilled at identifying clinical areas that need \nnew approaches and solutions but can often identify and overcome the local barriers \nto make the innovation happen. What is needed now is a system architecture that \ncan facilitate/catalyse this grass roots innovation, similar to that seen in the MedTech \nindustry. For example Medtronic have an innovation budget where employees with a \nnew device idea are given seed funding and the time out of their normal duties to \ndevelop the innovation. They also have the necessary translational infrastructure to \nmake the innovation happen. Empowering the NHS grass roots is the only \nsustainable way to deliver rapid, widespread adoption and diffusion of innovation \nacross the system. \n \nARU and the PMI - a partnership for change \n \nAnglia Ruskin University recognised that to drive change forward across the \nUniversity and Healthcare sectors a new kind of partnership was needed. The \nunderlying principle of this partnership would be a bottom up/pull approach where the \nuniversity would facilitate local clinicians and academics to develop the changes in \npostgraduate medical education, medical research and medical innovation that those \nindividuals/groups wanted to see. This approach of nurturing local expertise has led \nto the establishment of the Postgraduate Medical Institute (PMI). Through this facility \nclinicians from all the hospitals and primary healthcare groups in Essex as well as \nsocial care providers partner each other in driving forward excellence and change in \nthese three key areas. \n  \nIn research our mission is to improve health and social care through translational \nresearch in our core research centres. Our focus is on making a real difference to \nhealth and social care across local, national and international communities by \nexploiting close to market opportunities.  \n \nIn postgraduate medical education we assist our partners to develop a range of \neducation programmes from short courses to academic pathways at Masters and Doctoral level. This is creating closer clinical networks both formal and informal \nacross our county. \n \nProgress in medical innovation is key to the future health of our nation and is one of \nthe focal points for the PMI. We are not only systematically addressing cultural \nbarriers to innovation in healthcare but are also creating a translational infrastructure \nthrough our MedTech campus that will be world leading in providing all the necessary \nelements for MedTech development to be present in one location. \n \nIn all these areas the PMI is particularly focussing on close to market, scalable \nopportunities, so that the benefits of our work can be delivered rapidly into both \nnational and international markets. Our partnership approach across the healthcare \nproviders in the county has proven effective in breaking down barriers between \ninstitutions that previously saw each other as adversaries. This is bringing benefits in \nterms of getting innovation adoption across the region. \n \nOur underlying innovation vision is to be driven by the prospect of what is possible, \nprovide quality at reduced cost and empower grass roots led innovation across the \ncountry. \n \n \nCatalysing adoption and diffusion of MedTech Innovation  \n \nInnovation in the NHS ? call for evidence, will gather contributions from across \ndifferent sectors both in the UK and internationally. The systematic analysis of this \ndata will provide a plan for delivering accelerated adoption and diffusion of innovation \nacross the NHS. At a local level, we have already started identifying and addressing \nthe barriers to innovation. The innovation progress made at Southend Hospital is a \ngood example of how listening to what was going on at a local level and then \nfacilitating that expertise, can create an innovation partnership with national and \nglobal impact. \n \nInnovation at Southend Hospital and ARU: \n \nThree years ago the Trust board at Southend Hospital agreed to establish an \nInnovation dept. Executive and Clinical leads for innovation were appointed and an \ninnovation seed fund was created. The aim was to make the clinical innovation \nprocess realistic and easy to use for all Trust staff by facilitating the development of \ntheir ideas. This facilitation came in part through an analysis of the local behaviours \nand cultures that stood in the way of innovation and then putting systems in place to \novercome these. An innovation development pathway was established and an \nEnterprise company, Enterprise Medical Ltd (EML), was spun out. Innovations are \nassessed between the innovation department and EML. Those with commercial \npotential are further developed by EML and those ideas of clinical benefit alone are \ntaken forward by the innovation department. EML has now raised over ?2m of private \nsector funding to deliver its first commercial innovation project; a new generation of \nendoscope reprocessing unit on the Trust site. It has already signed its first ?3.5m \ncontract to reprocess scopes and is in negotiations to provide this service to over 100 \nprivate sector hospitals across the UK ( see http://www.enterprisemedical.co.uk ). \n \nTwo years ago ARU through the PMI partnered Southend hospital in its innovation \nprogram. The Clinical lead for innovation was appointed as Director of Medical \nInnovation at the University and linkages across the counties healthcare providers \nare now being developed. One of the outputs from this is the creation of an Early \nAdopters Group. This is a group of leading consultants, GP?s and other healthcare \nworkers across the county who are prepared to champion new innovations, identify \nand overcome barriers to implementation locally and work with the group to gain \nuptake across the region.  \nThis partnership has allowed a focus on medical innovation to occur not through top-\ndown dictates, but through grass roots-up ideas with facilitation through the Trust and \nthe University. A further output of this collaboration is a vision to catalyse MedTech \ninnovation is through a private sector led MedTech Campus. \n \nIdentifying Innovation Catalysts \n \nAnother important aspect of the ?NHS Innovation call for evidence? will be the \nidentification of elements that have the ability catalyse innovation. These elements \nare not just passive barriers that are removed but are active ingredients that promote \ninnovation. One such proposal is the Anglia Ruskin University MedTech campus.  \n \nThe Anglia Ruskin University MedTech Campus ? a catalyst for medical \nInnovation \n \nThis concept arose from partnerships that have been created through the PMI. We \nasked our partners and the MedTech industry how we could facilitate innovation in \nareas that they want to take forward. Healthcare partners wanted a place where all \naspects of the MedTech development pathway could be facilitated, from idea \nprotection, through funding, prototyping, trails, CE marking and selling a product into \nthe market as well as support in establishing their own spin out companies. Industry \nwanted access to funding, expert opinion and customers. These grass root needs \nhelped formulate the proposal for our MedTech campus. \n \nThe campus will be private sector led and provide a translational infrastructure that \nbridges the gap between NHS/academic centres, industry, customers, government, \nNGO?s and Citizens. It will ?pull innovations? from all these sectors and accelerate \ntheir exploitation at scale. At its core will be an innovation centre providing business \nincubation, support services and lecturing/conferencing/networking capabilities. This \nwill be surrounded by a MedTech business park containing office and manufacturing \nspace, primary and secondary healthcare facilities and academic research institutes. \nThis private sector led approach validates our vision that high quality innovation can \nbe delivered at a lower cost. \n \nThere are several benefits of the MedTech campus over existing innovation \narchictecture: \n \n1) Rapid adoption and widespread use of new treatments and technologies facilitated \nthrough the MedTech campus will provide an incentive in the marketplace to develop \nthe next generation of innovations, creating a virtuous circle.   \n \n2) Bringing all the necessary elements for MedTech innovation to one location will \nenhance collaboration, co-operation and integration allowing NHS staff to introduce \nand scale up new ideas and technologies. \n \n3) Will provide a one stop shop approach to assessing and developing innovative \ntechnology, medical devices and care pathways. \n \n4) Partnership with Global MedTech blue chip companies will allow ideas to be taken \nto scale, integrated and propagated across the global healthcare community. \n \n5) Start-ups in the innovation centre will provide a flow of ideas to the larger \ncompanies and can tackle niche market opportunities more easily than the larger \nplayers. \n \n6) It will have horizon scanning capabilities, scouring the globe for the latest \nMedTech innovation opportunities.  \n7) Create international linkages which will allow the development of MedTech to take \nplace in the most suitable environment, which may be in a partner country. \n \n8) Will create a reward structure for innovators and adopters ? along commercial \nlines \n \n9) The campus will give physical presence to the core of the networks that will be \nestablished with a full range of professional services and intermediaries working with \nthe companies to help spot emerging opportunities. \n \n10) Will establish an innovation framework with key outcome measures such as time \nto profitability, time to return of capital investment, quantified added value of \nproposed innovations. This will act as a common language for all the partners in the \nmedtech campus \n \n11) Allows us to learn from other sectors + countries e.g. industry, voluntary \norganisations and pull new ideas. \n \n12) The MedTech campus will create leaders in innovation, diffusion and adoption \nthrough SME?s, Clinical partnerships and the Early Adopters Group. They will create \nshort term wins, consolidate, anchor and mainstream change. \n \n13) Provide a key location for global Medtech companies looking to establish a \npresence in the UK/Europe. \n \n14) The MedTech campus will facilitate access to the market for products through the \nhealthcare customer partnerships at the PMI and through including the latest \ntechnology innovations in our education programs both to the 8000 healthcare \nundergraduates at ARU and to the 10,000 healthcare workers across the county \nthrough the ARU Faculty of Health and Social Care and the PMI. \n \n \nSuggested Actions ?  \n \nWe are driving forward a new culture and architecture for innovation at a local and \nregional level through the partnerships at the Postgraduate Medical Institute. The \nfollowing suggested actions would not only enhance our grass root innovation activity \nbut would also help facilitate and coordinate groups across the country to deliver \nadoption and diffusion of innovation at pace and scale.  \n \nOur three key suggested actions are: \n \n? Identify accelerators of innovation and facilitate these.  \n? Make innovation part of the NHS system architecture at a local level and \nprovide grass roots support/empowerment to deliver innovation \n? Develop a national network of translational infrastructure to deliver rapid, \nscalable system wide MedTech innovation. This must be a private ?public led \napproach and ensure that DoH and BIS thinking on this is joint and that major \nbuy- in is secured from the private sector. \n \nThere are multiple smaller scale actions that arise from these three key areas, these \ninclude: \n \n1) Reform of NHS IP and Innovation policies to allow adoption of an ?Open \nInnovation? culture. \n2) Support changes in UK tax regulation for the medical device industry  3) Allow all publicly funded healthcare providers to spin out their own \ncompanies/enter into joint venture companies with others.  \n4) Create incentives (both financial and practical) to encourage adoption of new \ninnovations, which will create a virtuous circle of more innovations. \n5) Establish a private sector seed fund for NHS spin out companies \n6) Use grass root generated centres of innovation/entrepreneurial excellence, as part \nof a mechanism to provide government and its institutions with leading edge \ninnovation information. \n7) An effective communication and marketing strategy needs to be co-ordinated \nacross the NHS to allow local initiatives to be scaled up and national ones to be \nscaled appropriately for local application. \n8) Create support networks both formal and informal e.g. support the creation of \n?Early Adopter Groups? across local networks and facilitate their work. \n9) Provide business guidance, mentoring and support for Trusts that want to spin out \ncompanies. \n10) Allow products that are made as a result of NHS innovation to be branded as \nNHS and help establish products in the market by placing them on the NHS \ncatalogue \n11) Get buy-in from professional bodies, such as the royal colleges, from an early \nstage so that innovation and its adoption is included in their education programmes.  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThere is no choice; innovation has to be grass roots led to get ?buy-in?, it has to be \nmade part of the daily activity in the NHS and translational infrastructure that can \nfacilitate the whole innovation process needs to be provided if new procedures and \ntechnologies are to be adopted rapidly across the whole healthcare system.In the NHS the main barrier to innovation is not usually resistance from its staff or \norganisations, who broadly welcome the concept, but is more the failure to identify \nand address both inhibitors and accelerators of innovation in a systematic and culture \nwide manner, particularly at grass roots level. There is also a lack of translational \ninfrastructure to facilitate the whole innovation process. \n \nAt a local level we have begun identifying specific barriers to innovation, these \ninclude: \n \n1) Inadequate funding ? seed funding to get innovation is almost exclusively taken \nfrom public sector sources. It is very limited, difficult to access and often over \nsubscribed many times. \n2) Risk avoidance ? Innovative ideas are often dismissed as too risky, either clinically \nor financially   \n3) Siloing ? Once groups are established then tend to become self protecting / \nsustaining and resistant to change from outside. \n4)Time commitments ? NHS staff are often too busy delivering day to day service \nrequirements to spend significant time innovating, which is not part of their job plan. \n5) Incorrect measures ? targets often measure the wrong thing. Commercial \nmeasures such as time to profit, or time to return of initial investment or added value \nwould be more useful.   \n6) Inadequate data ? quality data is key to making the case for an innovation. \nGathering good information is often time consuming and difficult. \n7) Little supportive system/cultural architecture ? Many national or regional level \ninnovation organisations/systems exist but little of this translates to a local working \nlevel. For example there is little business guidance, mentoring or support available \nfor Trusts spinning out innovative companies. \n8) Poor rewards/incentives ? IP exploitation policies are seldom used by NHS Trusts \nbecause they are so stacked against the innovator few staff bother to take their idea \nthrough the innovation process from idea through to a service/device that is widely \nused across the NHS and beyond. In fact the majority of ideas that have gained \nworld wide acclaim and usage have been taken by their inventors to the private \nsector at an early stage with the NHS receiving no benefit.  \n9) Lack of tools/capability ? mechanisms and mentoring to allow clinicians and \nmanagers to deliver innovation are not in place.  \n10) A failure to provide a supportive leadership culture at a local level. \n11) What translational infrastructure for MedTech Innovation there is in the UK is \nscattered around various public and private sector organisations. This is not co-\nordinated and there is no ?one stop shop? in the UK to facilitate MedTech innovation. \n \n \n"]},

views on policy options are factored into the FSA?s on-going negotiation in respect of Credit Risk in Basel and the EU; and\n \n\tensure that firms receive feedback at the CRSG meetings on the way in which the issues they have raised have been factored into the FSA's policy.\n\n Within five working days of a CRSG meeting, the FSA will: \n \tcirculate minutes from the meeting, comprising action points for the FSA and CRSG members; and\n \n\tpropose a draft agenda for the next meeting.\n\n Within ten working days of a CRSG meeting, the FSA will: \n \tpublish on its website the final version of the CRSG minutes.\n\n Five working days before a CRSG each meeting, the FSA will: \n \tsupply CRSG members with the agreed meeting agenda;\n \n\tprovide policy papers explaining the RBCD policy issues that the FSA is seeking to resolve and the proposed solutions to them.\n\n ?\n CRSG members\n \n The CRSG members are responsible for: \n \tdeveloping the CRSG agenda providing views on the appropriateness, and practicality, of the FSA?s proposed solutions to policy issues;\n \n\twhere proposals are considered inappropriate or impractical offering alternative solutions to policy issues in respect of RBCD credit risk implementation in the PSB;\n \n\treviewing, and providing suggestions for improvements to, Handbook text in respect of Credit Risk;\n \n\tassisting the FSA in assessing the overall cost and benefits for UK firms of implementing proposals for credit risk. \n\n ?\n Interaction with other FSA groups\n Where an issue arises that requires senior level involvement from firms or the FSA, it will be referred up from the CRSG to one of the following FSA Advisory Groups: \n \tthe Basel Advisory Group, where it is a matter of policy; or\n \n\tthe PSB Advisory Group, where it is an issue of the way in which our policy is articulated in the PSB.\n\n ?\n Meeting frequency\n CRSG meetings will be held on monthly and ad hoc meetings may be held where necessary.\n ?\n Circulation of CRSG papers\n CRSG members are free to circulate papers within their organisations and, in the case of trade associations, around trade association members to gauge industry views.\n Disclaimer\n The papers and meetings of the group are intended to enhance continued discussion of the topics rather than to present a comprehensive account of the issues or a set of agreed conclusions. The minutes of the meetings report the discussions of the group, but neither the papers or minutes nor any reported remarks by anyone present at one of those meetings should be read as representing either the formal positions of the member institutions or of the FSA. The FSA's policy proposals will be subject to consultation in the normal way.\n  \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n \n\t  \n\t  \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nArea is Locked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t      \t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAbout the FSA\n\tAbout us\n\tDoing business with us\n\tFSA Library\n\tFSA Handbook\n\tThe FSA Register\n\tCareers\n\tContact us\n\n\n\n\tSite information\n\tAccessibility\n\tData protection\n\tLegal information\n\tFreedom of information\n\tPrivacy policy\n\tClear English Standard Award\n\n\n\n\tWhat's going on\n\tLatest publications\n\tEvents\n\tConsumer Information\n\tFacts and figures\n\n\n\n\tAreas of interest\n\tHow do I get authorised?\n\tUK Listing Authority\n\tIndustry training\n\tFinancial crime\n\tGABRIEL\n\tONA\n\tSmaller firms\n\tBeing regulated\n\n\n\n?\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "Not for Publication \nOverview and Scrutiny \nManagement Board \n \n \n28 March, 2011 \n \n \n \nScrutiny Review of Area Action \nPartnerships \n \nReport of  Lorraine OâDonnell, Assistant Chief Executive \n \nPurpose of the Report \n \n1 To provide Members with information on the Scrutiny review of Area Action \nPartnerships (AAP).  \n  \nBackground \n \n2 In accordance with the Councilâs Forward Plan of Key Decisions and the \nOverview and Scrutiny Management Board Work Programme, a working \ngroup has been established to undertake a Review of Durham County \nCouncilâs Area Action Partnerships. The Working Group has cross-party \nth\nmembership and at its first meeting on Friday 4 March 2011, it agreed the \nattached Terms of Reference (copy attached at appendix 2) for the Review \nprocess. \n \n3 At that meeting it was also agreed to send a letter to partners and \nstakeholders providing information about the review, and inviting participation \nand involvement in the process.  This letter was sent to: \n \nâ¢ All Members \nâ¢ Chairs of AAP Boards \nâ¢ Clerks of Town and Parish Councils \nâ¢ Voluntary Sector organisations \nâ¢ Partners \n \nRecommendations \n \n4 That the Overview and Scrutiny Management Board (OSMB) note the \ninformation in this report, and receive the Terms of Reference for the Review \nof Area Action Partnerships. \n \n5 That further updates be given to the OSMB during the review process. \n \n \n \nContact: Feisal Jassat  Tel:  0191 3833506 \n \n  \nAppendix 1  \nFinance  \nWill be reflected in the final report of the review \nStaffing \nWill be reflected in the final report of the review \nEquality and Diversity \nWill be reflected in the final report of the review \nAccommodation \nNone \nCrime and Disorder  \nNone \nSustainability \nNone \nHuman rights \nNone \nLocalities and rurality \nCounty wide. \nYoung people \nWill be reflected in the final report of the review \nConsultation \nConsultation will take place with stakeholders and partners, as well as members of \nthe AAP Boards. \nHealth \nNone        Appendix 2 \n \nOVERVIEW AND SCRUTINY REVIEW \n \nDURHAM COUNTY COUNCIL AREA ACTION PARTNERSHIPS \n \nTerms of Reference \n \n \nRationale \n \nArea Action Partnerships (AAPs) have been established for 14 geographic areas \nwithin County Durham following an extensive public consultation which concluded in \nMarch 2009. A key facet of the original Unitary Status bid, AAPs are seen as the \nbridge between the Unitary Durham County Council and the diverse needs of the \nCountyâs communities. \n \nThe AAP is the mechanism through which the Council works with local communities \nand key Partners to make sure those local services meet local needs and that the \nvoice of the community is heard within the service development process. AAPs aim \nto enable Councillors, residents and partners to come together and influence \npriorities and take decisions in the light of local needs and circumstances. \n \nA key element of the AAP Terms of Reference is their performance management \nand review methodology arrangements. This includes specifically, a joint review \narrangement between partners represented on the AAP Boards and the Councilâs \nOverview and Scrutiny function to monitor the effectiveness of AAPs. \n \nThe Inaugural meetings of the 14 AAPs took place between April and May 2009 and \nthey have therefore been operational for almost two years.  \n \nIt is therefore considered timely to undertake a systematic process of AAP Review \nthat will look back to consider if they are âfit for purposeâ, and to look forward within \nthe context of the Coalition governmentâs policy agenda to ensure that they are âfit \nfor the futureâ. \n \nAim \n \nA central aim of the proposed review will be to evaluate AAPs, examining practices \nand processes to establish:- \n \nâ¢ the difference that they have made \nâ¢ areas for further improvement \nâ¢ the potential for further refinements in light of a changing policy and partner \nenvironment. \n \nObjectives \n \n1. To review the journey so far against:- \n \n The agreed AAP Vision, Aims and Objectives \n National and Local Policy Drivers  \n     The identified priorities, concerns, needs and aspirations of Partners, \nStakeholders and the local Communities \n \n2. To identify and highlight examples of good practice and \n initiatives/achievements to share between AAPs. \n \n3. To set and agree baselines for future performance measurement and \n improvement. \n \n4. To collate evidence of âWhat difference AAPs have made?â \n \n5. To identify areas for improvement and development in order that the \n Councilâs AAP structure can best reflect:- \n \n The aims and aspirations of the Council and its partners \n The national policy agenda of Localism and âThe Big Societyâ \n The changes to the Partnership Environment within County Durham \n \n6. To evaluate how AAPs can demonstrate that they provide Value for \n Money. \n \n7. To review and reflect upon the AAP funding allocation policies in light of the \nGovernments Comprehensive Spending Review and the impact of this upon \nthe County Council (and Partnersâ) Medium Term Financial Plan(s). \n \nScope \n \nSet against the Objectives detailed above, the Scope of the review will be framed \nwithin a series of Key Lines of Enquiry (KLOEs) which will cover:- \n \nâ¢ Governance Arrangements \nâ¢ Resources \nâ¢ Community Involvement/Engagement \nâ¢ Impact \nâ¢ Performance Management \n \nWithin each KLOE, a number of questions are proposed to ascertain the evidence \navailable to support the progress that has been made against each Objective. These \nare appended to this report. \n \nMethodology  \n \nThe proposed methodology for the review will involve a significant amount of âDesk \ntop Researchâ including collating and analysing evidence/information from AAP staff.  \n \nThis will be supplemented by a series of Focus Group meetings and Face to face \ninterviews with key individuals and organisations including:- \n \nâ¢ AAP Chairs (Past and Present) \nâ¢ AAP Board and Forum Members including Public members and Heads of \nService within the County Council \nâ¢ Town and Parish Councils \nâ¢ Key Partner Organisations \n        â¢ Voluntary Sector Organisations including those who have received funding \nsupport from AAPs \nâ¢ AAP Staff \nâ¢ The Public \n \nFocus Group Proposals \n \nAs part of the Review of Area Action Partnerships, a number of Focus Group \nsessions are to be arranged where key stakeholders will have the opportunity to \nprovide evidence to the Review Working Group. \n \nTo ensure that all AAPs have the chance to input to the review, 14 Focus Group \nsessions will be held during the course of the review â One for each AAP. \n \nIt is proposed that the participants in the sessions will be placed into five groups, with \nrepresentatives of the Working Group joining each table.

Perhaps Cat?s stolen my identity and has hidden it underneath his whiskers!?\n\n              Cat?s eyes opened fast and then he sprang to his feet.\n\n              Cat screeched. ?Your Highness -? Not me!?\n\n              Queen would have none of his excuses.? \n\n              ?If I have lost my identity then ...then who are you? If I no longer know you to be whoever you are, then whoever you are does not exist!?? \n\n              Cat?s fur stood up on end, his eyes opened wide. \n\n              Queen brought her face closer in to this unidentifiable object once known as Cat, and with her Crown still askew she said: \"What is left of that identity that both you and I thought we to be is gone! Vanished!? \n\n              Cat leapt through the air onto the windowsill and made a terrible noise on the glass as he scratched to be let out. Then he turned and bowed so lowly that he almost fell off the ledge....\n\n              ?Your Majesty...? Cat said.... ?You will always be my Queen...and I your humble servant, M. le Cat.?\n\n              ?M. le Cat?? What is that?? What is Cat?? As for all the rest of what you have said I know not of!? Your Majesty?and Queen?? Are these frivolities you name? Of what nonsense do you speak??? \n\n              Queen lifted the Crown off her head, brought it under her nose for closer examination then in one swift gesture put it on Cat's head.? \n\n              Cat stared anxiously but dared not purr.? \n\n              Cat!? You napped in the wrong place! \n\n              Cat meowed and meowed to be let out.? \n\n              The invisible Queen said.? A little less purrfect, M le Cat, than you thought yourself to be, hmmm??? Queen in name only ? A dint or not a dint!!!? A Queen or not a Queen? A Cat or not a Cat??\n\n              Then the invisible Queen leant forward and lifted her Crown back off M le Cat?s temple and she began to pull it back into shape. She patted it back on her head again and then she paced around the room. \n\n              ?It?s the way that it is! I am wearing the so-called Queen?s crown with a slight dint in it. We are both a little less purrfect a Queen and Cat than you and I thought ourselves to be.?? \n\n              With that, Cat sprang to his feet and leapt into the so-called Queen?s arms. The Crown with the slightest dint in it toppled off her head and smashed into trillions of pieces....\n\n              Both he and Queen grinned at each other.\n\n              Now we are both free of a fixed identity!\n\n              The cat-less M. le Cat purred and the so-called Queen laughed...journey to be continued.\n\n        ?

Gwynebau?r swyddogion Plaid Cymru yma?n edrych yn ddigon llwm ychydig yn �l, sy?n awgrymu buddugoliaeth i Guto Bebb?.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23.05pm: Fflur Jones yn Delyn yn dweud ei bod hi wedi siarad � chanfasiwr ifanc sy?n ?bryderus? yngl?n �?r canlyniad yno. Ychwanegodd bod nifer o bleidleiswyr apathetig wedi mynd allan i daro pleidlais heddiw, a?u bod nhw?n obeithiol yngl?n ag ail ethol David Hanson, ond nad yw?n ?bosib gwybod? beth fydd y canlyniad heno.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMae?n debyg bod 6396 o?r 7469 ofynodd am bleidlais post yn Delyn wedi ymateb. Canlyniad gwell na?r arfer ac yn awgrymu bod bobol yn awyddus i gymryd rhan eleni.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23pm: Cyn arweinydd y Lib Dems yng Nghymru, Mike German, yn dweud nad ydi?r pol piniwn yn ?sgwario gyda beth ydw i?n ei deimlo ac yn ei weld?.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBetsan Powys yn dadansoddi pleidlais De Sunderland ? p�l piniwn wedi awgrymu gogwydd o 7.5% yma, ond mewn gwirionedd y ffigwr yn 8.4%. Petai hyn yn cael ei adlewyrchu?n gyffredinol, byddai?n ddigon i roi mwyafrif clir i?r Toriaid.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.57pm: Cwymp pleidlais Llafur yn De Sunderland wedi mynd i?r pleidiau llai yn hytrach nag y Ceidwadwyr. Yn �l Vaughan Roderick ar yr S4C, bydd Llafur yn hapus gyda hynny os ydi o?n batrwm cenedlaethol?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.54pm: De Sunderland wedi ennill y ras i gyhoeddi gyntaf! Mae?n nhw?n falch iawn o?r ffaith mai nhw sydd gyntaf bob tro. Ond mae na gymaint o ymgeiswyr fe allen nhw gymryd cymaint i ddarllen yr enwau ac i gyfri?r pledleisiau. Buddigoliaeth gyntaf i Lafur? mwyafrif mawr o 10990, ond Llafur wedi colli 12% o?r bleidlais?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.51pm: Mae?n debyg nad ydi?r Gwyrddion yn ffyddiog y bydden nhw?n sicrhau eu AS gyntaf erioed, Caroline Lucas, heno ?ma.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.49pm: Un o swyddogion Plaid Cymru yng Ngheredigion newydd ddymuno lwc da i Luke Evetts, ymgeisydd y Ceidwadwyr. Chwarae teg iddo. Ond gan ddweud ?y mwyaf o bledleisiau wyt ti?n eu hennill, y gorau fydd pethau i ni?.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.45pm: Llawer o s�n am giwio yn y blychau pleidleisio, a fod pobl wedi methu pleidleisio oherwydd hynny. Adroddiad o Sheffield fod heddlu wedi eu galw mewn i symud pobl sydd wedi bod yn ciwio am oriau, ac wedi methu pleidleisio.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Stevenson, BBC yn adrodd o Ynys M�n ? pobl Llafur a Phlaid Cymru yn dweud fod y canlyniad yn rhy agos i?w ddarogan. Disgwyl i?r canlyniad gael ei gyhoeddi am 1am. Peter Rogers ydy?r ?wildcard? ym M�n, ac mae o wedi bod yn hyderus iawn yngl?n a?i obeithion dros y dyddiau diwethaf.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.44pm: Y si ar Twitter yn awgrymu fod y Ceidwadwyr wedi gwneud yn dda iawn yn Nyffryn Clwyd. Sedd Llafur, gyda?r Ceidwadwyr yn herio?n gryf.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.40pm: Swyddog Adroddol Delyn yn awgrymu fod y turnout yno yn o leiaf 70%, sydd i fyny dipyn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNewyddion o etholaethau Islwyn ac Alun� a Dyfrdwy yn awgrymu fod disgwyl i?r canlyniadau gael eu cyhoeddi ynghynt na?r disgwyl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.38pm: Jackie Ashley o?r Guardian yn ymateb i?r p�l piniwn gan ddweud ?nad oedd y rhan fwyaf o bobol yn meddwl y byddai?r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yn gwneud cystal ag oedd heip Cleggmania yn ei awgrymu wythnosau yn �l?. Pam wnaeth y Guardian newid ei gefnogaeth o Lafur i?r Dems Rhydd felly? Hmmm?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.34pm: Yng nghyfri Ceredigion, mae ymgeisydd Llafur, Richard Boudier yn dweud fod ganddo gyfle i ennill, a bod ei ods wedi newid o 100-1 i 35-1. Mae pethau mwy rhyfedd nag hynny wedi digwydd yng Ngheredigion. e.e, Plaid yn mynd o bedwerydd i gyntaf yn 1992?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.30pm: Yn siarad o?i etholaeth yn Hull, mewn ymateb i?r arolwg barn, Alan Johnson wedi dweud ?rydym yn paratoi?n hunain ar gyfer pedwaredd tymor?.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBetsan Powys yn siarad ar y BBC yn dweud bod nifer y bobol wnaeth bledleisio yn mynd i fod yn uchel. ?Bu?n rhaid i mi giwio i bleidleisio am y tro cyntaf erioed heddiw?. Hyn yn dangos bod mwy o gyffro o gwmpas yr etholiad eleni?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.28pm: Mae?r p�l piniwn yn awgrymu na fydd hi?n noson cystal �?r disgwyl i?r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol, a?u bod nhw?n debygol o golli seddi. Ond mae pob sylwebydd wedi nodi nad ydyn nhw?n ffyddiog yngl?n �?r ffigyrau, am eu bod nhw mor wahanol i beth oedd y polau piniwn cyn yr etholiad yn ei awgrymu, sef y perfformiad gorau ers degawdau i?r Dems Rhydd.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYng Nghymru mae?n dasg anodd i?r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol. Ar un llaw mae angen iddyn nhw amddiffyn Ceredigion rhag Plaid Cymru, a Maldwyn a Brycheiniog a Sir Faesyfed o?r Ceidwadwyr. Fe allen nhw golli pob un o?r rheini heno, a dim ond Canol Caerdydd fyddai gyda nhw ar �l.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYn fwy optimistaidd mae gyda nhw obaith da o gipio Gorllewin Abertawe o ddwylo?r Blaid Lafur.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeth sy?n drawiadol am y p�l piniwn ydi ei fod o?n awgrymu nad oes dim byd wedi newid, mewn gwirionedd. Roedd y polau piniwn yn dangos canlyniad tebyg i hwn cyn y dadleuon teledu, Cleggmania a popeth arall.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.20pm: Yn �l Bleddyn Bowen yng Ngheredigion mae?r Gwyrddion yn hyderus eu bod nhw wedi gwneud yn dda heno. Maen nhw?n credu eu bod nhw wedi ennill dipyn o gefnogaeth oherwydd eu gwrthwynebiad i ddifa?r moch daear, polisi sy?n cael ei gysylltu gyda Phlaid Cymru, ac ehangu trafnidiaeth gyhoeddus yn y sir.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllai pleidlais gref i?r Gwyrddion gael effaith mewn ras hynod o dynn rhwng Plaid a?r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.17pm: Yn �l Andrew Marr ar y BBC byddai gan David Cameron ?ddigon o seddi i lywodraethu? pe bai?r p�l piniwn yn wir. Ond dywedodd fod yna ?rywfaint o amheuaeth? yngl?n �?r ffigyrau.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.15pm: Gan Fflur Jones yn nghyfri Delyn ? ?Wrth ddisgwyl y blychau llawn pledleisiau yn Delyn mae Llafur yn brysur iawn yn gwneud eu ffordd o amgylch y neuadd yn cymdeithasu gyda?r rhai sy?n cyfri. Arwydd eu bod nhw?n gyfforddus iawn ynteu ydi?r ffaith eu bod nhw yno ymhell cyn y pleidiau eraill yn awgrym o ddiffyg hyder??\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.10pm: Richard Wyn Jones ar S4C yn awgrymu y gallai?r bleidlais post gael effaith, gan bod 20% o bobol wedi pledleisio ?tra bod Cleggmania ar ei anterth?. Ond byddwn i?n awgrymu mai pobol h?n, hynny yw y bobol sydd lleiaf tebygol o gael eu heffeithio gan Celggmania, fyddai?n pledleisio drwy?r post yn y lle cyntaf?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10pm: Bong! Yn �l arolwg barn y BBC, ITV a Sky News fe fydd yna Senedd Grog gyda?r Ceidwadwyr yn fyr o 19 sedd. Y ceidwadwyr ar 307, Llafur ar 255, y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol ar 59?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDa i?r Ceidwadwyr, ond siomedig iawn i?r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol. Mae Richard Wyn Jones wedi wfftio?r ystadegau ar S4C gan ddweud nad ydi o?n eu credu nhw.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.55pm: Mae?r BBC wedi gwario �10m ar noson yr etholiad, mae?n debyg. Bydd y cyflwynydd Jeremy Vine yn cerdded i lawr Stryd Downing rhithiol, gyda pob llechfaen ar y ffordd yn cynrychioli sedd. A pob un yn arwain at ddrws Rhif 10, mae?n siwr?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBydd hi?n ddiddorol gweld beth sydd gan S4C ar ein cyfer ni.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.50pm: Yn �l PA mae David Cameron wedi bod yn treulio dwy awr yn torri darnau o bren gyda bwyell. Mae?n si?r bydd ei ben o ar y bloc os nad ydi?r Ceidwadwyr yn ennill mwy o seddi na?r Blaid Lafur heno?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMae Gordon Brown, yn y cyfamser, wedi cael stiw cig oen i swper gyda?i wraig Sarah ac wedi cysgu am ddwy awr.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFe wnes i gysgu am ddwy awr gynne fach, cyn cael fy neffro, yr eironig, gan bobol yn mynd a dod o?r orsaf bleidleisio yn neuadd y pentref sydd reit drws nesaf i fy nh? yng Ngheredigion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDylai p�l piniwn ar y cyd ITV, BBC a Sky News, y tro cyntaf i?r tri darlledydd Prydeinig gyd weithio yn y fath ffordd, gael ei ryddhau mewn 10 munud?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.30pm: Ers 1997 dim ond chwe sedd mae Llafur wedi eu colli yng Nghymru, ac maen nhw wedi ennill un yn Ynys M�n. Fe allen nhw golli pump yn hawdd heno ? Bro Morgannwg, Gogledd Caerdydd, Gorllewin Caerfyrddin a De Sir Benfro, Aberconwy, ac wrth gwrs Ynys M�n.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAr noson ddrwg fe allai?r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol ennill Dwyrain Abertawe, fe allai?r Ceidwadwyr gipio De Clwyd, Dyffryn Clwyd a Delyn. Ac fe allai Plaid gipio Llanelli.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOs ydyn nhw?n cael noson erchyll fe allen nhw hyd yn oed golli Pen y Bont ar Ogwr a Gorllewin Caerdydd i?r Ceidwadwyr. Fe fyddai hynny?n embaras o ystyried mai dyma seddi cyn Br�f Weinidog Cymru, Rhodri Morgan a?r un presennol, Carwyn Jones, yn y Cynulliad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUn sedd allen nhw ei ennill er gwaetha?r chwalfa fel arall ydi Blaenau Gwent, ble mae ymgeisydd Llais y Bobol, Dai Davies, yn AS ar hyn o bryd. Ydi?r posibilrwydd o lywodraeth Geidwadol yn ddigon i wneud i bobol yr etholaeth dyrru yn �l i?r Blaid Lafur?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.55pm: Mae yn sawl sedd i?w gwylio yng Nghymru heddiw ac r?yn ni wedi ymdrin � nhw mewn mwy o fanylder isod.

Cofiwch, does gan neb wir syniad sut ganlyniad y cawn ni heno ? er bod y rhan fwyaf o bolau piniwn yn awgrymu y bydd gan y Ceidwadwyr y mwyaf o seddi mewn Senedd Grog.

Sunderland South oedd y cyntaf yn 2005 ond dyw?r etholaeth yna ddim yn bodoli bellach. Bydd Houghton and Sunderland South a Sunderland Central yn cystadlu am y wobr eleni.

It is important to target interventions at those groups most likely to gain the greatest health benefit.\n\tThe use of lipid regulating drugs must be viewed within the overall range of effective interventions for secondary prevention patients: aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, smoking cessation, diet, cardiac rehabilitation programs.\n\tThe use of lipid regulating drugs in primary prevention should also be viewed within the context of other effective interventions: smoking cessation, hypertension control, diet, exercise, which need to be considered before drug therapy.\n\tConsideration of the appropriateness for drug treatment in primary prevention must not be based solely on cholesterol levels but on the overall absolute risk of CHD assessed using Qrisk cardiovascular risk calculator. \n\tTredaptive has had its licence withdrawn January 2013 across Europe after a study has shown a failure to reduce major vascular events and an increase in non-fatal serious adverse events. Both the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee have concluded that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks.?

The funding is part of the UKOER rapid innovation programme that runs until October 2012. The project we have funding for is called ?Attribute Images? and it will extend the Xpert Attribution Service.\n\nThe Xpert search engine currently provides access to 270,000+ open learning resources. Xpert was funded in 2009 also as a JISC rapid innovation project and the Nottingham built system has now matured into one of the largest collections of Open Educational Resources (OER) in the world. It was extended in 2010 to include the Xpert Attribution Service. This service currently allows users to carry out searches for Creative Commons licensed images available in Flickr and automatically attributes the images that it finds with a Creative Commons licence statement. This service has a proven user group, with over 61,000 images attributed through the service in 2011. However, one limitation of the service is that it relies upon metadata stored with the picture in Flickr to generate search results. This can mean search results displayed in the Xpert Attribution Service are not always relevant to the user.\n\nThe Attribute Images project will extend the Xpert Attribution service by creating a new tool that allows users to upload images and have a Creative Commons attribution statement embedded. This will remove the reliance on images stored in Flickr, and put the power to attribute specific images into the hands of the user. Automatically embedding open licences simplifies content development, removes barriers to repurposing and publishing OER, and substantially increases the usability of open content. Automating licence attribution also enhances digital literacy around the use of third-party images, as the tool enables best practice in relation to attribution to be followed. The tool will include a bulk-upload option. It will provide an option for the user to upload the newly attributed images to Flickr through the Flickr API. It will record and report the number of images that have been attributed and the number of newly attributed images uploaded to Flickr. It will be made available as part of the Xpert site, providing access to an immediate and established user group. In addition it will have an API allowing developers to make use of the service in other sites.\n\nA requirement of the JISC project proposal was to include an openly licenced use case. I have included it below as helps to further explain what we are doing and why we are doing it.\n\nUse Case for Attribute Images\n\nThe Problem: There is no established internet service enabling users to upload images in bulk, automatically incorporating Creative Commons attribution and copyright statements into the images and then allowing the user to share the annotated images openly. The lack of such automated services costs the time of those involved in use, re-use, creation and publication of OER, both when attributing images manually and when clearing copyright.\n\nLack of attribution within images is a significant barrier to re-using third-party content, since provenance and permissions are often difficult to ascertain. Where images are Creative Commons licensed (as part of larger, parent resources or within open websites), the licence is often stored in nearby metadata and not attributed as part of the image. Attribution information will therefore not travel automatically with the image when it is inserted elsewhere. This is a problem: Creative Commons licences demand that correct attribution be given.\n\nThe Solution: Create a tool that allows users to upload images (singly or in bulk), select a Creative Commons licence and specify the name of the copyright holder, publication date and a URL. The tool then embeds a licence attribution statement in the image. It should allow users to save the image locally in various sizes and also to embed images within PowerPoint. To maximise sharing and discoverability, the tool should facilitate uploading the newly attributed images to Flickr. It should also provide an API, enabling others to include the attribution functionality in other websites.\n\nOER Practitioners: When publishing OER, OER practitioners from the UKOER programme have reported taking most time in the provenance and copyright clearance of third-party materials, particularly when content comes from multiple sources containing different media. This is a significant pain point for publication and reuse. Practitioners will benefit from a simpler and time saving process (both when attributing copyright safe images and when replacing unsafe ?orphan? images and from having more attributed images available.\n\nEducational Institutions: The existence of an automated service will give educational institutions that have (or are considering) an OER programme greater confidence: an automated service reduces the risk of legal challenges about inappropriate use of third-party images.\n\nAcademics/Tutors: Subject specialists using, re-using or creating open content will benefit from a much simplified and speedier attribution process. The workflow helps users that are unsure of best practice relating to attribution learn what their licence choices mean. This educational element of the tool improves digital literacy; the tool?s automated aspects enable appropriately attributed output.\n\nThird-party Rights Holders: The primary source content providers? knowledge that an automated tool exists which provides appropriate attribution and clear permissions statements and developed within the JISC/HE community may encourage co-operation by third-party rights holders in future dealings with the HE and OER communities.\n\nTechnical Developers: Developers will benefit from an API, allowing them to embed the tool in other websites. De-coupling the service from the parent Xpert site supports the proliferation of open academic practice by allowing technical developers to support local users.\n\n\t\t\t\tS Stapleton\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\tPost a comment\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tClick here to cancel reply.\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne comment for ?

I want to ask Peonic if this thread's existence is okay.  When I get new pretty games, I like to take pictures of it running off of my tv.  I've taken a bunch with Heavenly Sword cause it's flippin' gorgeous.  I know other people do it as well.  I don't know if anyone on this board does it.  But anyways, would a thread like this be okay if we don't post spoiler pictures?  Just want to admire a gorgeous game, that's all!\n\n\n\nEdit: okay, editing the title of the post didn't edit the title of the thread.  Can someone add 56K beware to the thread title?

There are games like doa4 that let you take photos.  But even then they're at like 1/4th of the resolution.  When I was taking these pictures, I had to pause the game here and there to try to get good shots.  It's unfortunate that there's a fade in and fade out effect.  Hopefully there'll be an option to clear everything off of the menu that pops up when you push start so we can at least see the whole from in its glory.  And obviously, it'd be better if we could save screenshots to the hard drive.  But I figure that could lead to a whole lot of spoiling and what not.\n\n\n\n\n\ndeepbrown\nSeptember 18th, 2007, 09:43 AM\n\nHeh, thanks.

I don't work on rumours....you're dealing with the wrong man for that.  I have the hard facts that this feature is available to developers and the amount of memory it uses.  It's unclear whether a game developer has to impliment it, or whether it will be system wide, but since it will only use 3mb memory, I expect Sony will allow it for every game.\n\n\n\nAnyway, although I like to have an air of mystery and knowledge.  This is quite well known and from a reliable source:  Innerbits.\n\n\n\n\"Three new \"utilities\" available to developers:\n\n\n\n   1.

They carry out this task by presenting their collections not according to time periods or schools of influence, but according to experiences the viewer will have of love, courage, and other virtues and consolatory emotions. De Botton writes, ??We have too easily swallowed the modernist idea that art that aims to change or help or console its audience must by definition be ?bad art??and that only art that wants nothing of us can be good?. ?What if [museums] decided that art had a specific purpose ? to make us a bit more sane, or a little bit wiser and kinder ? and tried to use the art in their possession to prompt us to be so??\n\nDe Botton is aware of the power of art to affect our psychological health, and to influence our moral formation. ?He lauds Christian art because it ?teach[es] us how to live, what to love and what to be afraid of?. Modernist art, on the other hand, ?wants nothing of us?, and therefore results in ?confusion? as ?a central aesthetic emotion?. There is no attempt at communication between artist and viewer, and so there is no community. Christian artists communicate experiences of ?tenderness? and ?courage? through their works, to teach moral lessons. De Botton suggests that museums can become churches if viewers can learn these lessons through art.? I personally would be interested in visiting a gallery arranged according to his suggestion, and I applaud his suggestion that curators can help their patrons become more loving and virtuous people.\n\nChristian art, however, is effective in teaching these lessons because it is viewed as part of a community. De Botton writes that, ?Christian art amounts to a range of geniuses saying such incredibly basic but extremely vital things as:??Look at that painting of the cross if you want a lesson in courage??. First of all, artists paint the cross for much greater reasons than to provide an example of courage. A painting of the Crucifixion can also be an invitation to love, and an offering of praise, for example. Second, a painting of the Crucifixion can only provide a ?lesson in courage? if the viewer is aware of the story of the Crucifixion, and these stories are handed on by a community ? partially through art, but primarily through the sharing and enacting of the stories in church, in the central activity of worship. De Botton is aware of the story of the Crucifixion because of the presence of churches in society, which not only teach the meaning of the story, but also live it, and so can respond to and be formed by depictions of the story in art more thoroughly than can those outside the story?s community.\n\nChurches?are?places of consolation, meaning, sanctuary, and redemption, but not because they aim at providing these experiences directly. Churches are not self-improvement centres for the individual believer. Instead, they are centres of?communion?? vertical communion with God, and through Him horizontal communion with other church members. They exist for a community to love ? and be loved ? by God.\n\nVisitors to the de Botton art museum may experience, and by experiencing learn, virtues and receive consolations through art. But only the further, outward-directed response of worship and the living of the story, in community with other worshippers, will make them into the communion of God that is?Church.\n\n?\n\nShare this:\n\tTwitter\n\tFacebook\n\tEmail\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n        \t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n            \n\n    \n\t\t\n    Commenting Policy: Any comments are solely the responsibility of the author and do not reflect the views of Transpositions or ITIA.

There are many Christians such as myself who rarely take part in communal worship in a church. When I experience art, (music, galleries, museums, books, poetry)) which I do  far more readily and often than I go to church,  I believe I am participating in a valid act of worship. Art ? whether overtly or ostensibly ?Christian?- is a powerful expression of wonder and creativity, celebrating (God-given) life in all its variety.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCole Matson\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 11, 2012 at 3:21 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tElizabeth,\n\nI agree that Christianity is ?a completely satisfying explanatory conceptual framework within which to live one?s life?. However, it is not only a conceptual framework, but a relationship, with God and with one?s fellow Christians. The necessity of gathering with others to worship God through shared prayer (liturgy) has always been part of Christianity, and a part which is not optional. I agree that one can worship through the experience (and creation) of art, and to do so is a very good and nourishing thing. I?ve been known to use The Lord of the Rings for lectio divina. However, one?s personal, individual experience of God through artistic contemplation is a supplement to shared worship with one?s church community, and ought not be a a replacement of it.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTim SJ\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted January 30, 2012 at 9:44 AM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tI though Terry Eagletons review of De Botton?s book was spot on. ?  ??Hijack other people?s beliefs, empty them of content and redeploy them in the name of moral order, social consensus and aesthetic pleasure.

Prayer and contemplation, for example, are not life-giving if approached as a means to that end, as if as long as one prays in a certain way or for a certain amount of time one is guaranteed ?results?. Any benefits that arise from prayer and contemplation only arise because the relationship with God that is the heart of prayer is the goal ? or, rather, because God Himself is the goal. When you remove God from the equation, prayer and contemplation lose their ability to confer benefits, except perhaps the trace benefits that come from any attempt to settle the mind and reach out to something deeper (which actually brings God back in, whether or not the person is aware of it).\n\nHowever, I admire de Botton for his ability and willingness not to dismiss religion, as so many of his fellow atheists do, but to acknowledge and seek to promote the good he does find in it ? even when his attempts to promote this good are uncritically dismissed. Even though I think his project of creating a kind of ?secular church? removed from a belief in God is ultimately self-contradictory, and can?t work in the way it seems he would like it to, I think he is one of those ?men of good will? whom we pray for in the liturgy (and, in a way deeper than they know, in some sense pray with).\n\nBlessings on your tertianship!\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMichelle G\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted January 31, 2012 at 4:55 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGreat response to a thought-provoking article.  I was struck by de Botton?s recognition of the ?inner needs? for the ?consolation, meaning, sanctuary, redemption? and his observation that the answering of these needs were previously the domain of churches.  Sad emphasis on ?previously.?  There are a great many churches ? which Matson correctly defines as communities ? that have abandoned beauty in general and art in particular as ?distractions? or ?uneccessary luxuries.?  The former completely misses the role visual reminders play in the spiritual life and the latter falls into the Judas trap of ?not wanting to ?waste? money on seemingly useless expressions of beauty.?\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCole Matson\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 11, 2012 at 4:12 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tMichelle,\n\nRight on! I also wonder whether our culture?s denigration of art that is used for something, as opposed to merely contemplated (like in a museum), is a factor in the decline of art used for worship. After all, art has always been a part of Christian worship, as well as the worship of Israel preceding Christianity. I don?t want the liturgy interrupted by moments of artistic contemplation, as if the only way art can be helpful in the church?s worship is when a moment is taken to focus on the art for itself. However, I do want us to worship through art ? through music, vestments, vessels, images, and architecture that are some of the ways that the people of God worship ? all brought together in the service of the liturgy.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEric J.

Your discussion of community is spot on, and fills in the large gap in de Botton?s portrayal of Christian art.\n\nI?m intrigued by the idea of art centers serving the role that churches do for the faithful.\n\nDe Botton is right that those who go to galleries and museums (atheists and faithful alike) would be better served if, as he says, the ?veneration of ambiguity? made way for presentations  that allow art to provide ?consolation, meaning, sanctuary, redemption.? The fact is, good art can offer this, and if modern secular people perceive that they need something in their lives analogous to a ?church?, centers of art may play that role as well as anything else outside an actual church. At the least, it is a sincere attempt to acknowledge and address their needs as best they choose.\n\nIn addition, allowing art to speak to human needs can benefit churches as well. Galleries (taken broadly) speak to one important part of the human experience. Churches speak to other aspects, but could speak to this one as well if they chose. In fact, until the Church really gets back into the business of engaging society through art and culture, it is effectively saying to all those content with galleries alone: we have food for hungers you don?t even know about; but we?re not listening to you speak of the hungers you do know about.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCole Matson\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 11, 2012 at 4:19 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tEric,\n\nI don?t have much to add other than you?re correct that museums do a good job of trying to fill this need for ?consolation, meaning, sanctuary, redemption?, and since this need is part of the human soul, churches ignore it at our peril. I don?t want to see churches deciding to be museums, either, as if all churches need to have art galleries in their parish halls and theatrical performances and concerts in their sanctuaries. But the church can support those who have a vocation to artistic creation ? whether they?re makers of sacred art or workers in the secular sphere ? and remember that there is an aesthetic dimension to our worship, whether we acknowledge it or not. To decide to ignore aesthetics is itself an aesthetic decision.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjfutral\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 11, 2012 at 6:09 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t(As a quick aside, the notion of modern galleries grouping art by period reminded me briefly of movies in the movie _The Invention of Lying_.)\n\nSeems the author of the referenced article has been reading or listening to Suzi Gablik and/or her book _Has Modernism Failed?_. Certainly what some postmodernists/ism is responding to is the hyper-individualism that has been pushed in the 20th century. And rightly so.\n\nHowever, one cannot counter or attack that without remembering a large part of what drove that, particularly the World Wars and nationalism, and to various degrees before that similar attacks on the individual by institutions, whether monarchy, tyranny, or -isms like Socialism or Communism, or other forms of nationalism. Even within Christianity, many of the divisions occurred over seemingly undue power of an individual or institution over everyone else.\n\nWhile it is true enough (as another respondent posted) ?authentic religion ? which is always rooted in a believing community??, it is also true from scripture that the individual is as important. The community does not exist without the individual, as I think is an especially clear teaching from the Trinity. There is a symbiotic balance that cannot allow one to overrule the other.\n\nSo Modern art evolved to remove dictating what the viewer should experience and interpret, as the counter to representational art, even or especially Christian art. Even here in this discussion, people seem offended that the Crucifixion should be interpreted as an act of courage, beyond its strict religious representation. Which strikes me odd since it is very much that, even when it is everything else mentioned.\n\nIn this regard Modern art isn?t so much that it doesn?t _want_ anything of us. Rothko would say Modern Art only lives _through_ the viewer, it requires us. Modern art is just not willing to impose on us. It is the prior form of representational art that does not require anything of us and lectures us.\n\nThis is not to say that as we moved into later 20th century that Modern artists did not take on this bent. As mentioned, Suzi Gablik bemoans this attitude as why Modernism has failed. In as much as Modern Art has taken this hyper-individualistic view?to the point of removing even the individual or ?other??I agree with both the referenced article and this post.\n\nIn a post-Christian world, what the article wants to find outside the church should be taken to heart _by_ the church, not attacked or countered, as churches are even now meeting in museums and theatres beyond the walls of traditional church structures, both physical and authoritative. When the system takes on more importance than what the system was created to support, we should always be concerned. Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\n\nJust my thoughts. I could be wrong.\n\nJoe\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCole Matson\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 14, 2012 at 7:30 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tJoe,\n\nThank you for your excellent comment. I agree with you that it would be equally wrong to seek to subsume the individual in the communal. The danger in the suggestion that private contemplation in a museum can provide the same thing as the experience of church, to me, was partly in its emphasis on the individual at the expense of the communal, so that?s where I placed my focus in this post.\n\nI know that Modernism often sees traditional art as oppressive, as dictating a response from the viewer, but I don?t see it that way. Even the most didactic of medieval art, for example, is trying to give a good to the viewer ? to teach him more about God, for example. I?d hope we can value the lessons such art tries to impart as a gift, not as an imposition.\n\nI also wondered if making the main point of my post an area in which I disagreed with de Botton would make it seem as if I thought his ideas had no value. I think we in the churches need to listen to people who say, ?I need beauty and contemplation and sanctuary, and I can?t find it in the Church?. That?s a big problem. But de Botton also seems to be advocating (in a part of the article I didn?t directly address) a return to the understanding that art does form us in certain ways ? its meaning is not just created by the viewer. As I said, I would love to visit a museum that had created an exhibit based on his suggestion to arrange pieces not by time period or culture, but by their effect on our spirit.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjfutral\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 15, 2012 at 8:57 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tI don?t see pre-Modern art that way either, but I understand what they are saying. Or that this is necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. Iconography is supposed to present a very specific message. I do not believe that strips the work of its inherent beauty and artistry. I do think it is important, within analysis of art and the effects and possibilities, to remember the origin of such things, what the artists were responding to. \n\nUltimately the work has to speak for itself, and good art always does. But Christians in particular get caught up in some mysterious non-Christian propaganda of art that often does not exist when critiquing art, especially Modern art. Not that you have done this. I have simply come across this myself, even participated.\n\nHow much of particularly Western evangelical Christian ecclesiology has become the focus of the individual? Personal saviour, Personal relationship with God, God loves _you_, personal spiritual growth. We may gather collectively, sing collectively, but we wait for God to speak to _me_, seek a puncticular experience. We gather to hear the same message (often from a singular person) in pretty much the same way we go to see art in a museum or see a movie at a theater. And just as often the same results occur.\n\nAnd how much of what we seek from the church experience is similar to what we seek from art? Relevance, approachability, some way to help us understand the world we live in, the issues we face day to day, sometimes even to simply be challenged. In some ways the museum is freer. I can feel joy or sadness or tragedy without form of guilt for being superfluous or not spiritual enough.\n\nThe only thing I really disagree with you about is to qualify your comment?art _can_ form us, but not really form us except in as much as the work gives us some level of insight into something we may be facing or struggling with, or the chance to remove ourselves from that struggle, if only for a moment, and experience or be reminded of something else, something within the work we can respond to, individually or communally.\n\nJoe\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCole Matson\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 17, 2012 at 2:26 AM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tJoe,\n\nI?d agree with you that art doesn?t form us necessarily, in that anyone exposed to the same piece of art will be ?formed? in the same way as a result of that exposure. However, I think art can form us in more ways than just giving us insight or reminding us of something else. For example, I stopped watching the TV show Family Guy (which I would consider art, though it wouldn?t come under the category of fine art made for contemplation that would be at home in a museum) because I found that, after a couple years of watching it regularly, my sense of humour became more coarse and sarcastic, and often I found jokes and cutting remarks coming to my mind (and to my lips) that came from the show. I found that being exposed to that work of popular art was forming my imagination and language in ways that were not healthy, so I stopped watching it. So I think there can be a level of unconscious formation, which can either be helpful or harmful.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjfutral\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted February 17, 2012 at 2:42 PM\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGood point, and I certainly did not mean my list of possible affects to be construed in anyway as exhaustive.

financial performance, with turnover growing by 5.6% in the last 12 months. Turnover and gross profit growth of 5.1% is expected for the next 12 months. \n\tHeadcount remains static, firms only expect to have 0.6% more staff this time next year. \n\tGlobal economic conditions are having a negative impact on export growth, with firms now expecting growth of just 2.9% for the next 12 months. \n\tOnly 8% of firms now report the tax burden they face to be a greater challenge now than it was a year ago, 25% found it an increasing challenge in Q3 2011. However, a substantial 59% report regulatory requirements to be a greater challenge than a year ago.\n\n\n\n    \t\n        BCM Q3 2012 report ?

In a u-turn, the government has announced that companies will only have to make payments in the second year of the scheme, not the first as originally planned. Taking on another EEF proposal, guidance will also be published earlier than expected, allowing companies longer to prepare for the scheme. \n\nFor further information contact Amisha Patel, Climate and Environment Adviser \n\nTreasury Minister briefed on Pre-Budget priorities\n\nWe continue to make the case across government for a stable business environment for manufacturers as the economy moves from recession to recovery. This week, we met Economic Secretary, Ian Pearson, to discuss the state of manufacturing and EEF?s Pre-Budget recommendations. \n\nFor further information contact Lee Hopley, Head of Economic Policy\n\nEEF takes manufacturing debate to Conservative Conference\n\nConservative Shadow Treasury Minister, David Gauke MP, joined high-profile economist Professor Patrick Minford and our own Steve Radley at EEF?s fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester this week. The debate was enlivened by questions from a number of EEF members in the audience and was part of our wider campaign to highlight the importance of manufacturing. \n\nFor further information contact Jennifer Huckstep, External Affairs Adviser \n\nBusiness Minister urged to prioritise measures for economic growth\n\nAs part of a group that briefs the government on the state of the economy, EEF this week highlighted our key policy priorities to Pat McFadden MP, the Business Minister. We argued that government?s main priorities for promoting economic recovery should be easing the tax and regulatory burden on business, investment in skills, and taking active steps towards creating a better balanced economy. \n\nFor further information contact Steve Radley, Chief Economist \n\nAssurances sought on new environmental civil sanction powers\n\nWe have urged the Environment Agency to be proportionate in administering proposed new civil sanction powers on business. We have been assured that the powers would only be invoked where repeated non-compliances were recorded and where prosecution through the courts was considered unnecessary. \n\nFor more information contact Kevin Considine, Senior Climate & Environment Policy Adviser\n\nAgency Workers Directive campaign continues\n\nWe continue to lobbying for a delay to the Agency Workers Directive. Meeting government officials this week, we were informed that draft regulations are imminent and will include a proposed implementation date. We are concerned that introducing this proposal during the current economic climate will discourage companies from taking on agency workers at the very time when demand could be picking up.\n\nFor further information contact David Yeandle, Head of Employment Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the news...\n\nOn Monday our Innovation Report featured in the FT. Manufacturing Output figures released on Tuesday underlined our view that the recovery is going to be a difficult one and we were quoted in the FT , Guardian and Daily Telegraph. \n\nThe Conservative Party Conference was the big story of the week and we were asked to comment on the Conservative Party?s policies for manufacturing. Finally our Head of Employment Policy David Yeandle took part in a live blog during David Cameron?s speech for Personnel Today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Focus: \n\nFrom Waste to Resources - what next for government strategy on waste?\n\nEEF has called on the government to rethink its waste strategy to reduce costs to manufacturers. \n\nThe handling of waste is a significant cost to UK manufacturers and a key environmental issue. Sustainable waste management and resource efficiency is therefore an important part of successful business models. Over 95% of respondents to a recent EEF survey cited managing waste as a key priority for action. \n\nIn a policy paper, published today, we evaluate the government?s progress in delivering its two year old waste strategy. We focus on the key challenges and opportunities for UK manufacturers from current government policy and make a number of recommendations for improving the strategy and delivery of policy objectives to reduce costs to manufacturers. In doing, so we argue for a shift in thinking from waste as a problem to a valuable resource, as well as a more outcome-based and strategic approach across waste and resources policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Data\n\nLatest economic indicators\n\n\n\n\t\n? Manufacturing output \n\t\nManufacturing output fell by 1.9% between July and August.\n\n\t\n? Trade \n\t\nThe goods trade deficit narrowed to ?6.2bn in August, compared with ?6.4bn in July. \n\n\t\n? Services PMI \n\t\nThe services PMI rose for the third consecutive month in September, climbing to 55.3. \n\n\t\n? New car sales \n\t\nNew car sales were 11.4% higher than a year ago in September. \n\n\t\n? House prices\n\t\nThe Halifax house price index showed house prices were 1.6% higher in September than in August. House prices have risen in four of the past five months. \n\n\t\n?? Producer prices\n\t\nAnnual output price inflation rose to 1.4% in September, up from 0.8% in August. Annual input prices were 6.5% lower than a year ago. \n\n\t\nMPC meeting \n\t\nThe MPC voted to hold interest rates at 0.5% and continue with its ?175bn asset purchase programme . The programme is likely to take another month to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?\n\nComing up...\n\nForthcoming data and statistics\n\n13 October: Inflation figures, ONS; House Price Survey, RICS \n\n14 October: Labour market statistics ONS \n\n15 October: EEF Pay Bulletin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForthcoming events...\n\nEEF?s manufacturing debate - 'Can manufacturing save the UK economy?' - will be?hosted by the BBC?s Stephanie Flanders.\n\nJoin an audience of manufacturers and policymakers as we discuss the future of our industry. \n\n6pm - 9pm, 21 October 2009\nThe Royal Society, 6-9 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AG\n\nRegister now for your free place at the debate\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tForthcoming events\n\t\t\t\nFilter by region: \n\nAll regions |\nNorth East, Yorkshire & Humberside | \nMidlands | \nSouth East | \nSouth West | \nNorth West | \nWales\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\nDeveloping Tomorrow?s Leaders Today\n\n\n15 March 2013 - 9:30-12:00 at EEF, Warrington\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEEF National Manufacturing Conference and Manufacturers' Dinner\n\n\n5 March 2013 at Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEEF Occupational Health Service National Clinics\n\n\nVarious dates & locations ? see full details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Lead and Sustain a Lean Culture\n\n\n21 February 2013 - 9:00am-12:00pm (FULLY BOOKED - WAITING LIST ONLY) at St James's House, Birmingham\n1 March 2013 - 9:00am-12:00pm at EEF, Cambridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember Briefing - Health, Safety, Climate & Environment\n\n\nVarious dates & locations ? see full details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember Briefing: Employment Law Update\n\n\nVarious dates & locations ? see full details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\nAbout EEF\n\n\tWho we are\n\tHow we work\n\tWhere to find us\n\tPartnership opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\t\nMembership\n\n\tBusiness support and advice\n\tIndustry insight\n\tNetworking for manufacturers\n\tPolicy & representation\n\tMember advantages\n\n\n\n\n\t\nConsultancy\n\n\tBusiness improvement services\n\tClimate & environment services\n\tHR & legal consultancy\n\tInformation & research services\n\tManagement & personal development programmes\n\tOccupational health & safety consultancy\n\n\n\n\n\t\nTraining & development\n\n\tApprentice programmes\n\tHealth and safety training\n\tEnvironmental training\n\tHR development & employment law courses\n\tManagement training courses\n\tPersonal development courses\n\tEngineering skills training\n\tLEAN training courses\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\nJump to footer navigation\n\t\t\n\n\tapprentices\n\toccupational health\n\tvenues\n\taccessibility\n\tprivacy\n\tregister\n\trss feeds\n\tterms & conditions\n\tUK Steel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @EEF_Insights\n?\nFollow @EEF_economists\n?\nFollow @EEF_environment\n?\nFollow @EEF_press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The very name ?30 Assault Unit? made it sound like a good figure to work on, but once I had started to research what 30AU actually was, it intrigued me even more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure itself for the most part is dressed and equipped in standard British Commando items.  On the surface he could be any British commando during WWII.  However, to ensure his individuality as a figure I decided to assign him to No. 36 Royal Navy Troop, which constituted part of 30AU.  Therefore, he wears ?Royal Navy? badges on his arms, alongside his distinct ?30? badge.  He is also wearing parachute wings, indicating that he is parachute trained, as were most 30AU members.  On his green beret he also wears a Chief Petty Officers cap badge, indicating his Royal Navy rank.  Incidentally all the badges were made by Robin of One Sixth Scale King.  The Royal Navy Chief Petty Officer badge was made on my request and he did an absolutely outstanding job of it, complete with embossed gold detail.\n\n\n\nI also used some of Robins German stationary items and a German battle flag for the photos, alluding to the special role which 30AU had .  Following on from my PPA figure with reference to the beret style, I was in fact unable to pull the beret back ant further, due to the shape of the headsculpt?s hair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCategories\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWWII - 1937 - 1945\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t?

The entrants over 1000, (all born between 1991 and 1993) from every part of the UK, were inspired with the topic and produced many poems with the hint of promise.\n\nAt a lunchtime reception, as part of The Sunday Times Oxford Literary Festival, in Christ Church on Wednesday 24 March seventeen year-old Emily Harrison, from Cirencester College, Gloucestershire, won the ?3,000 first prize for her poem Love Has No Larynx.  The judges, the poets Stephen Romer, Michael Schmidt and Peter McDonald said that: 'Judging was difficult because of the general standard of entries.  We were pleased to see that the final six poems are so various in form and theme.'\n\nThe winner of the second (?1,000) prize is Katie Woods (John Taylor High School, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire) with Selkie and the third prizewinner (?500) is Megan Owens (Farlingaye High School, Woodbridge, Suffolk) with Jane Loudon.\n\nThe other short-listed winners, who each received ?250 were: Jamie Sutherland (Winchester College, Hampshire) with Dear Dad, Julia Goroszeniuk (St Paul's Girls' School, London) with A Portrait Painted Scarfless, and Hugo Havranek (St Paul's School, London) with Sign Language.\n\nIn addition to the presentation of prizes at the reception, Heather Uren, accompanied by Guy Newbury, gave a first performance of Feather-small and still, composed by Jonathan Pitkin.  The poem, Villanelle, written by Sophie Stephenson-Wright was one of the winning poems from the 2009 competition and was chosen to be set to music by Dr Stephen Darlington and Dr Peter McDonald.\n\nNow in its tenth year, the Christopher Tower poetry competition is one of the most prestigious poetry competitions in the UK, with a reputation for discovering fresh and exciting poetry talent. It is just one of the initiatives developed by Tower Poetry at Christ Church to encourage the writing and reading of poetry by young adults. Other projects include summer schools, poetry readings and conferences, an ongoing publication programme including the launch at The Sunday Times Oxford Literary Festival of A Tower Miscellany edited by Peter McDonald and a newly redesigned website which is used as an educational resource in schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n?\n\n                                                    \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbout Tower Poetry\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\n                \n        \n\n                    Tower Poetry exists to encourage and challenge everyone who reads or writes poetry. Funded by a generous bequest to Christ Church, Oxford, by the late Christopher Tower, the aims of Tower Poetry are clear: to stimulate an enjoyment and critical appreciation of poetry, particularly among young people in education, and to challenge people to write their own poetry. Creative writing should be a central element in literary education, and learning about writing poetry can help students to think about ways of reading poetry.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRead more\t\t\n\t\n\n\n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n            \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPublications\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Twelve:\n\nPoems from the 7th Tower Poetry Summer School 2010\nEdited by Daljit Nagra and Jo Shapcott\nThe Twelve contains 56 poems from the 12 young poets who attended the Summer School.\n?\n\t\t\n\n\t\n          \n                  \n        \n      \n              \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWebsite copyright ?

I settle for plain colours and eschew the ones with messages. Now you tell me: if you wear a tee-shirt which says \"Babe Magnet\" or similar on it are you actually expecting it to attract women or is it an ironic joke for ugly blokes to amuse their mates with? No, really, I don't know. \n\nAfter this I enjoy the ambient fruity perfume while buying stuff in Lush and then treat myself to a bacon and egg roll with tea in the sunshine overlooking the Marina.\n\nToday by contrast I am in the countryside enjoying the evidence of spring - the early flowers are much advanced after these few warm days (see my two pics - no bluebells yet but give it a week) and the silence is broken by the ratatat of two woodpeckers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The hour change is very welcome as now there are options for getting out after work which makes so much difference. For early birds like me it means getting up in the dark but it'll be light enough at 6 a.m. in about another two weeks.\n\n\nPostscript:\n\nMany will recognise the Town Mouse and Country Mouse as one of Aesop's tales. The idea is that the urban rodent scoffs at the frugal, uncosmopolitan hospitality of his peasant cousin but the latter finds the city unwelcoming and thoroughly dangerous. This strikes me as unfair to both milieus and surely the best option for mice and men is to make use of both town and country exploiting what they are each good for (\"Mice and men\" may ring a bell too but I'm stopping here as I don't want to go either to Rabbie Burns' silly poem or to Steinbeck's depressing novella).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nBill Walden-Jones\n\n\nat\n13:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nWednesday, 23 March 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nNervous Rex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrenetic activity this week as we work simultaneously on the forthcoming election campaign, the consultation on the draft Mental Health Measure Regulations, and the advance publicity for our summer campaign \"Taking the Wheel\", the subject of this post.\n\nWe are really pleased to have joined forces with our friends in MDF the Bipolar Organisation and the Mental Health Foundation to support people with experience of serious mental illness to run this campaign which will take off in earnest immediately following the election in May and carry on with events and rallies every week until the end of September. \n\nThe campaign will engage people receiving secondary mental health services or who have serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other diagnoses which typically require high levels of care.\n\n\n\nAs service-user led organisations Hafal and MDF the Bipolar Organisation Cymru will work in partnership with the Mental Health Foundation to support the campaign which will empower people with serious mental illness to:\n\n? Take the driving seat in managing their own recovery from serious mental illness.\n\n? Make use of their new rights under the Mental Health (Wales) Measure.\n\n? Make choices about the care and treatment they receive - and who provides it.\n\n? Develop and manage services themselves.\n\n? Engage with the providers of mental health services so that they can get involved in planning and commissioning mental health services.\n\n\"Taking the Wheel\" will feature a rally around Wales in our classic VW microbus with a number of regional and national events. 22 weekly events will take place from May to September, one in each county, and major displays will take place at the National Eisteddfod and Royal Welsh Show. At each event people will be able literally to ?take the wheel' as they race in a camper van rally simulator which promises excitement and fun.\n\nNow I've had a go on the simulator and was a bit sceptical beforehand but can report that the experience is utterly memorable and I staggered away giddy and, to be honest, a bit shell-shocked. You may sneer at my feeble impression of Nervous Rex but I dare you to have a go when it comes to your town! We will publish the dates and venues soon.\n\nThe Seminar launch of the campaign will explore ways in which service users can be empowered to take control of their own recovery and have their say on the services they receive.\n\n\"Taking the Wheel\" will be launched just after the National Assembly Elections providing an excellent opportunity for service users and carers to engage in current mental health campaigning issues, challenging the new Government to ensure that:\n\n? The Mental Health (Wales) Measure has a robust Code of Practice and Regulations.\n\n? The Assembly Government's Annual Quality Framework target for full compliance by the NHS with the Care Programme Approach is fully implemented.\n\n? There are sufficient resources for mental health services, and the mental health budget is protected.\n\n\n\nPostscript:\nFor the less literary among you Nervous Rex is the timid and easily-scared friend of arch softie Walter, Dennis the Menace's routine target for mean tricks and general contempt. Dennis turned 60 last week and he is still rebelling weekly in the Beano. However, a few years ago he became less mean to Walter as the publishers worried that it looked a bit homophobic. \nUnsure that this had cleared the matter up they then gave Walter a girl-friend which should have meant that Dennis could again beat him up without fear of opprobrium. But more recently and in a further wave of political correctness Dennis has ceased the fisticuffs and no longer carries offensive weapons.

Over 100 people have already queued up to register their support and we will be sending on all the responses to the Assembly Government.\n\nIf you are going to make a detailed response to the consultation then don't forget to say that you support Sue's View; if you simply want to back up what Sue is saying then just write to us, or, if you are a group, you might like to collect signatures on Sue's new Response Form. The latest edition of Sue's View plus all the details about how to respond can be found on this Link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nBill Walden-Jones\n\n\nat\n09:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nTuesday, 15 March 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nBallots and Bullets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing extensive consultation Hafal will shortly be publishing its Assembly Election Manifesto in anticipation of the poll on 5 May 2011. Final details are being settled but let me rehearse some of the issues here.\n\nOf course we need to quiz candidates and parties on the extent to which they are prepared to protect resources for mental health services (both NHS and local authority) and especially the funds needed for the most vulnerable, those using secondary mental health services, which presently require about 80% of mental-health-specific resources and will continue to need this level of support.\n\nBut resources aren?t everything. We are overdue for a new vision for mental health services and Hafal has been arguing for a long time that the best approach is to build a vision alongside the Mental Health Measure (which of course had cross-party support), in particular recognising the centrality of individual care planning for secondary mental health services and the use of such plans to promote a recovery-based approach. \n\nIt is probably too much to hope that political parties will set out a clear vision on mental health issues but we need to test their ? and individual candidates? ? approach and specifically whether they are prepared to take on board the views of mental health patients and their families and to respect their choices.\n\nWatch this space for more details ? I will draw attention to the Manifesto when it comes out at the end of the month. Incidentally, if that seems quite late in the day then let me explain that all experience indicates that nobody is remotely interested in such things until just a few weeks before the election itself ? so timing is everything!\n\nMeanwhile, two more key questions ...\n\n(1) Are there votes in mental health?\n\nQuite apart from the detail of what we want from our politicians we need to flag up the political significance of mental health in these elections for both voters and candidates. Hafal has rightly made as much noise about this at previous elections as about the policy matters because we need to convince everybody involved that mental health can influence the outcome of elections, especially in Wales where the devolution settlement places a particular emphasis on health and social care in National Assembly elections.\n\nTraditionally, it seems to me, mental health was discounted by politicians because they didn?t hear about it on the doorstep and at the hustings. Little wonder because of the stigma which would prevent people talking about mental health to their own families let alone at a public meeting. But this is changing, not least owing to Hafal?s efforts, and indeed we have seen much more about mental health in party manifestos in recent years as a result.\n\nBut we need to drive home this point and show that, in fact, mental health carries a heavy electoral punch if voters choose to exercise it. Consider: about one in thirty of us experience a serious mental illness in our lifetimes and it is not implausible to think that those people ? and their close families and friends ? would use their vote to support candidates who had an exceptional policy which would assist people with a serious mental illness.\n\n(2) Does the Assembly election cover all the key issues for people with a serious mental illness?\n\nThe short answer is ?no?.\n\nThe greatest concern of people with a serious mental illness and their families today is welfare benefits which are not a devolved area. We need to be sure that we are not deflected by the election from the challenge of influencing the current reform of both disability and general benefits. To this end Hafal has recently joined forces with other UK mental health campaigners to submit a response on reform to DLA and will do the same shortly on the Welfare Bill.\n\nCriminal Justice is the other key non-devolved area and Hafal will be watching how the UK Government moves forward following consultation on its Green Paper \"Breaking the Cycle\". More about this in due course.\n\n\nPostscript:\n\nThis year sees the 180th anniversary of the 1831 general election which saw riots and mayhem in the streets of Carmarthen. Tory candidate John Jones of Ystrad was injured in the violence and the election had to be postponed until August.\n\nCarmarthen traditionally takes its elections very seriously, in the past not trusting simply to the boring ballot box but employing bribery, corruption and intimidation to give the whole business a zest quite absent from today's contests. The rioting was so customary that to this day the two main streets leading to the town centre are known as Red Street and Blue Street where supporters of the Whigs and Tories respectively would congregate on election day to exchange abuse and, not unusually, gunfire.\n\nI suspect that amid this vigorous form of electioneering there was little attention paid to the attitudes of the candidates to improving mental health services but I am happy to be put right on that if you know better.\n\nMy own experience of Carmarthen's democratic traditions came during the 1983 election when I attended a brutal and combative hustings in the Civic Hall and fell over Labour leader Michael Foot during the cheese and wine afterwards. I would like to be able to report that this was due to a riot situation but in fact Footie was, like many politicians when you see them in the flesh, very short and I simply didn't see him - but he apologised to me which was generous in the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nBill Walden-Jones\n\n\nat\n12:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nSunday, 13 March 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n5,000 Volts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have received a few tuts from blog-readers about my apparent indolence at weekends, to which the only possible plea is a resounding \"guilty\". I take no credit in admitting a deep-seated horror of domestic chores of any kind and especially DIY projects. I'm not sure that I am necessarily bad at these jobs but I simply cannot muster the necessary Zen-like patience and application; in fact quite the reverse and I have been known to abandon small tasks for over a decade when some irritating obstacle wrecks the plan. For example there is a sawn plank sitting accusatorily in my shed which should have graced my \"study\" (a.k.a. second bedroom) as a neat bookshelf but fell foul of a rawl plug-related incident in 1997. One day I may get over it and try again.\n\nHowever, sometimes needs must or, more specifically, Mrs Blog requires something to be done. In the safety of mid-winter I agreed to check out on Google how we might thwart Mrs B's arch-antagonist - the badger and his family who over the last three years have devastated our root vegetables (a row of carrots in particular attracts these nocturnal nuisances like a line of Bolivian attracts Charlie Sheen). \n\nMy preferred option was to borrow the neighbour's Russian 4-10 and stake out the veg patch at dusk fortified by a thermos of sweet tea. But, you've guessed it, it's illegal to blow away cuddly Mr Badger who appears to have cleverly got himself covered under the European Human Rights Act - not necessarily an insuperable hurdle but it is in this case as there are undoubtedly people in the street of the urban, animal-hugging tendency who would summon Dyfed-Powys' best as soon as they heard the surprisingly loud report of the light-weight Baikal pop-gun. \n\nA long shot was to invite the Assembly Government's Minister of Agriculture Elin Jones to choose my garden for her notorious cull which was revived this week (see the story here) but she says she has her eye on Pembrokeshire.\n\nSo, the answer gleaned from the Internet is a 5,000 volt electric fence which I spend the day erecting. I avoid major expense by borrowing the fence materials from my brother and adapting an old set of car jump-leads to connect it up. The physicists among you may be interested to know that the fence only works if you literally earth the return connection in the soil (in my case using an old poker) and the current, being of such a vast voltage, can travel for a mile or more through the ground to complete the circuit and scare the sh*t out of the marauding mammal as he targets your precious crops. At least that's the theory.\n\nFor now at any rate the fence has done the trick: Mrs B gratefully shakes a mean Margarita which I enjoy while watching Wales whip the Irish against the odds as the sun goes down on an unusually industrious Saturday.\n\n\nPostscript:\nThe least useful link which I found on Welsh badgers may be seen here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nBill Walden-Jones\n\n\nat\n11:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nWednesday, 9 March 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nCapital Result\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first WAG consultation event on the draft Regulations for the Mental Health (Wales) Measure took place in Cardiff on Monday. Gavin Williams, Hafal?s Young People?s Lead, attended and reports back:\n\n?We put across our interest in the care planning aspects of the Measure. At present the Measure?s draft Regulations state that at least one holistic life area needs to be completed in a Care and Treatment Plan. The view from our service users and carers, which I put forward at the event, is that there needs to be a box to record eight life areas (accommodation, education and training, finance and money, medical and other forms of treatment including psychological interventions, parenting or caring relationships, personal care and physical well-being, social, cultural and spiritual, work and occupation) rather than a minimum of one and that all areas should be recorded for each individual. \n\nThis point was backed up by delegates who attended the event (there were about 50 in total) and put forward to the facilitators. Hopefully these events will lead to more effective care plans which will help service users to progress with their recovery.?\n\nSee more about this, including the rapidly growing \"Sue's View\" campaign, here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nBill Walden-Jones\n\n\nat\n15:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nMonday, 7 March 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nSue's View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSue Barnes makes a useful suggestion in her article this month in the Western Mail. She invites readers to try out the 8 life areas specified by the new Mental Health Measure against their own experience...\n\nThe Measure says all patients receiving secondary mental health services have the right to a care plan and that the planned outcomes must relate to one or more of the following areas: accommodation; education and training; finance and money; medical and other forms of treatment, including psychological interventions; parenting or caring relationships; personal care and physical well being; social, cultural and spiritual and work and occupation.\n\nIt?s clear to see why care plans are so important.\n\nThink how the areas above relate to you. Whether you have a mental illness or not, planning ahead in terms of your accommodation, your finance or your occupation is important.\n\nOf course, for someone with a mental illness these considerations become more important still, as all of these areas have a considerable impact on our mental health.\n\nFor anyone, the biggest step to recovery of mental health may be finding a great place to live, getting a job, establishing a good relationship with their family, meeting new friends or identifying a professional who can help them work through their problems.\n\nRead Sue's column in full here and visit the dedicated Sue's View pages on the Measure Regulations consultation here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nBill Walden-Jones\n\n\nat\n17:11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Posts\n\n\nOlder Posts\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Walden-Jones\n\n\nChief Executive of mental health charity Hafal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nBlog Archive\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\n2013\n(1)\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJanuary\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\n2012\n(125)\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nDecember\n(13)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nNovember\n(9)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nOctober\n(11)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nSeptember\n(3)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nAugust\n(11)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJuly\n(11)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJune\n(12)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nMay\n(10)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nApril\n(13)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nMarch\n(12)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nFebruary\n(10)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJanuary\n(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n? \n\n2011\n(150)\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nDecember\n(7)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nNovember\n(9)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nOctober\n(17)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nSeptember\n(11)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nAugust\n(12)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJuly\n(14)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJune\n(15)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nMay\n(14)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nApril\n(12)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n? \n\nMarch\n(12)\n\tMilk, Polo Mints and Dunhill International\n\tManifestly Sensible\n\tTown and Country Mouse\n\tNervous Rex\n\tSue's View Queue\n\tBallots and Bullets\n\t5,000 Volts\n\tCapital Result\n\tSue's View\n\tCeltic Arcadia\n\tTwit\n\tVote for (Your) Mental Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nFebruary\n(15)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJanuary\n(12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\n2010\n(153)\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nDecember\n(13)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nNovember\n(14)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nOctober\n(18)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nSeptember\n(14)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nAugust\n(22)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJuly\n(18)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nJune\n(19)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nMay\n(20)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n          ? \n        \n\n\nApril\n(15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nKey Links from Bill's Blog\n\n\n\tHafal\n\tHafal Facebook\n\tHafal Twitter\n\tMental Health Wales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Bill Walden-Jones.

This \nguidance should be read in conjunction with ?Stent?graft placement in \nabdominal aortic aneurysm? (NICE interventional procedure guidance 163). \n1.1 Endovascular stent?grafts are recommended as a treatment option \nfor patients with unruptured infra-renal abdominal aortic \naneurysms, for whom surgical intervention (open surgical repair or \nendovascular aneurysm repair) is considered appropriate.  \n1.2 The decision on whether endovascular aneurysm repair is \npreferred over open surgical repair should be made jointly by the \npatient and their clinician after assessment of a number of factors \nincluding:  \n? aneurysm size and morphology \n? patient age, general life expectancy and fitness for open surgery \n? the short- and long-term benefits and risks of the procedures \nincluding aneurysm-related mortality and operative mortality.  \n1.3 Endovascular aneurysm repair should only be performed in \nspecialist centres by clinical teams experienced in the management \nof abdominal aortic aneurysms. The teams should have appropriate \nexpertise in all aspects of patient assessment and the use of \nendovascular aortic stent?grafts.  \n1.4 Endovascular aortic stent?grafts are not recommended for patients \nwith ruptured aneurysms except in the context of research. Given \nthe difficulties of conducting randomised controlled trials, it is \nrecommended that data should be collected through existing \nregistries to enable further research.  \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 1  \n2 Clinical need and practice \n2.1 Aortic aneurysms develop when the wall of the aorta weakens, \ncausing it to bulge and form a balloon-like projection. This leads to \nfurther stretching of the wall of the aorta and an increase in tension. \nEventually the wall may rupture, leading to massive internal \nbleeding. Aneurysms are often a result of atherosclerosis and most \noccur in the abdominal section of the aorta. An abdominal aortic \naneurysm (AAA) is defined as an enlargement of the aorta of at \nleast 1.5 times its normal diameter or greater than 3 cm diameter in \ntotal. Most AAAs occur in the lower part of the abdominal aorta, \nbelow the kidney (infra-renal). The main risk factors for AAA include \nincreasing age, high blood pressure, smoking and family history of \nAAA. AAAs are about three times more common in men than in \nwomen. \n2.2 Most AAAs are detected by chance during clinical investigation (for \nexample, ultrasound or X-ray) for other conditions. Because most \nAAAs are asymptomatic, it is difficult to estimate their prevalence, \nbut screening studies in the UK have estimated a prevalence of \n1.3?12.7% depending on the age group studied and the definition \nof AAA. The incidence of symptomatic AAA in men is \napproximately 25 per 100,000 at age 50, increasing to 78 per \n100,000 in those older than 70 years. The implementation of a \nnational screening programme for AAA is under way with the first \ncentres expected to start screening by March 2009. The remaining \ncentres will be managed in a phased roll-out over the next 5 years. \n2.3 Symptoms that can occur as an aneurysm enlarges include a \npulsating sensation in the abdomen, back pain and abdominal pain \nthat may spread to the back. Patients with a symptomatic AAA \nneed rapid medical attention. Among patients with a ruptured AAA \nthe mortality rate is about 80%; even when they undergo \nemergency surgery, only about half survive beyond 30 days. The \nrisk of rupture increases with the size of the aneurysm, and those \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 2  \naneurysms larger than 6 cm in diameter have an annual risk of \nrupture of 25%. Several studies indicate that without surgery the \n5-year survival rate for patients with aneurysms larger than 5 cm is \nabout 20%. \n2.4 Patients with an AAA can be treated by surgical repair to prevent \nrupture. Conventional (open) surgical repair (OSR) involves making \na large incision in the abdomen and inserting a prosthetic graft to \nreplace the damaged section of the aorta. OSR can also be \nperformed laparoscopically, either by hand-assisted laparoscopic \nsurgery or totally laparoscopic surgery. Endovascular aneurysm \nrepair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive technique that involves a \nstent?graft being inserted through a small incision in the femoral \nartery in the groin. It is carried to the site of the aneurysm using \ncatheters and guide wires and placed in position under X-ray \nguidance. Once in position, the stent?graft is anchored to the wall \nof the aorta using a variety of fixing mechanisms.  \n2.5 Potential advantages of EVAR over OSR include reduced time \nunder general anaesthesia, elimination of the pain and trauma \nassociated with major abdominal surgery, reduced length of stay in \nthe hospital and intensive care unit (ICU), and reduced blood loss. \nPotential disadvantages include the development of endovascular \nleaks (endoleaks), which occur when blood continues to flow \nthrough the aneurysm because the graft does not seal completely \n(type I endoleak) or because of backfilling of the aneurysm from \nother small vessels in the aneurysm wall (type II endoleak). \nPatients who have had OSR do not require any special follow-up, \nbut patients who have undergone EVAR may require computed \ntomography (CT) or ultrasound scans to check for the presence of \nlate-occurring endoleaks. In addition, if EVAR is unsuccessful or \ncomplications arise during the procedure, conversion to OSR may \nbe necessary even in patients initially considered unfit for open \nsurgery. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 3  \n2.6 In current UK clinical practice, elective surgery is generally \nrecommended for patients with aneurysms larger than 5.5 cm in \ndiameter and with aneurysms larger than 4.5 cm in diameter that \nhave increased by more than 0.5 cm in the past 6 months. Current \nguidelines from the Vascular Society and the National Screening \nCommittee recommend that patients with symptomatic aneurysms \nof less than 4.5 cm in diameter should be followed up with \nultrasonography every 6 months, and aneurysms of 4.5?5.5 cm in \ndiameter should be followed up every 3 or 6 months. \n3 The technologies  \n3.1 The stent?graft typically comprises a self-expanding nickel?titanium \n(nitinol) stent attached to a woven polyester fabric graft. Bifurcated \ngrafts are modular with multiple segments: a proximal tube, a flow \ndivider, a full-length ipsilateral iliac limb and a short contralateral \nstump for attachment of the second iliac limb. The stent?grafts are \nattached to the aortic wall by metallic wires, hooks and anchors. \nAdditional modular components include aortic and iliac extender \ncuffs, which are used for the treatment of type I endoleaks. The \nmain types of endovascular stent?grafts are: aortic tube grafts (no \nlonger used in the UK), aorto-uni-iliac grafts and aorto-bi-iliac \n(bifurcated) grafts (the latter are most commonly used in the UK). \n3.2 Five stent?grafts have been included in this appraisal. These are \nthe Talent stent?graft (Medtronic), Excluder AAA endoprosthesis \n(WL Gore), Aorfix AAA stent?graft (Lombard Medical), Zenith AAA \nendovascular graft (Cook Medical) and Endologix Powerlink \nSystems (Le Maitre). All have been granted Conformit? Europ?ene \n(CE) marking for use within European Union (EU) countries. The \nindications for use for each of the stent?grafts vary; these are given \nin the instructions for each device. \n3.3 The individual endovascular stent?grafts made by different \ncompanies each have a different cost. Costs are further \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 4  \ncomplicated by the fact that patients who are fitted with the same \nmanufacturer?s device may require different numbers of \ncomponents. The manufacturers who produce the devices also \noffer different pricing structures; for example, some charge a price \nper patient regardless of the number of components needed, \nwhereas others base their price on the number of parts required.  \n3.4 Four of the manufacturers stated that their list prices were \ncommercial-in-confidence. Lombard Medical stated that the price of \ntheir Aorfix AAA stent?graft was ?5000, which was a fixed price per \npatient irrespective of the number of components used. A price to \nthe NHS of ?5000 was supported by limited sample data for \n2007/08 collected by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency from \nsome NHS organisations in England. These data confirmed that the \naverage price of an endovascular stent?graft, irrespective of the \nnumber of components used, was ?5000. \n4 Evidence and interpretation \nThe Appraisal Committee (appendix A) considered evidence from a \nnumber of sources (appendix B). \n4.1 Clinical effectiveness \n4.1.1 The Assessment Group identified studies of adult patients with \nasymptomatic or symptomatic, ruptured or unruptured infra-renal \nAAAs that compared EVAR using stent?grafts with conventional \nOSR and/or with non-surgical treatment (sometimes referred to as \nwatchful waiting). In their systematic review, the Assessment Group \nincluded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and large registries \nrelevant to UK practice. The registries included were the National \nVascular Database (NVD) for open surgery, the Registry of \nEndovascular Treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (RETA) \nand the European Collaborators on Stent?Graft Techniques for \nAbdominal Aortic Repair (EUROSTAR). Where appropriate, the \nAssessment Group used meta-analysis to estimate a summary \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 5  \nmeasure of treatment effect on relevant outcomes based on \nintention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. \n4.1.2 To identify criteria for selecting patients appropriate for EVAR, the \nAssessment Group also reviewed studies that modelled a large \nrange of risk factors. Risk-modelling studies were specific to AAA, \nfocused on risk of mortality following EVAR, and used appropriate \nstatistical modelling techniques. Studies were required to be based \non a trial, registry or a series of at least 500 patients from \ndeveloped countries of relevance to UK practice. \nEVAR versus OSR in patients with unruptured aneurysms \n4.1.3 Four RCTs compared EVAR with OSR in patients with unruptured \nAAA (EVAR 1, n = 1082; DREAM, n = 351; Cuypers and co-\nworkers, n = 76; and Soulez and co-workers, n = 40). Most patients \nin the RCTs were men, reflecting the disease profile, and the \naverage age of patients ranged from late 60s to mid-70s. The four \nRCTs were relatively homogeneous in terms of average aneurysm \ndiameter (6.5 cm, 6.0 cm, 5.4 cm and 5.2 cm, respectively).  \n4.1.4 All four RCTs reported 30-day mortality. The pooled estimate of \neffect suggested a significantly lower rate of 30-day mortality in the \nEVAR group: pooled odds ratio (OR) 0.35 (95% confidence interval \n[CI] 0.19 to 0.63). The 30-day mortality rate of 2.3% in the \nEUROSTAR registry was comparable with the 1.7% in the EVAR \narm of EVAR 1. In the UK NVD crude operative mortality following \nOSR of unruptured aneurysms was 6.8%, compared with 4.7% in \nthe OSR arm of EVAR 1. \n4.1.5 EVAR 1 and DREAM provided information on all-cause mortality at \nfollow-up (at 4 years and 2 years, respectively). Both RCTs \nreported no significant difference in medium-term mortality (at 42 \nand 35 months, respectively) in patients treated with EVAR \ncompared with OSR. A pooled analysis of the two trials confirmed \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 6  \nthat there was no statistically significant difference between EVAR \nand OSR for all-cause mortality at medium-term follow-up. \n4.1.6 The four RCTs provided limited information on rupture as a \nseparate outcome. The limited data available suggest that rupture \nmay be more of an issue following EVAR than following OSR. The \ncumulative rate of rupture in patients from EUROSTAR was 3.1% \nover 7 years. \n4.1.7 Only the EVAR 1 and Soulez and co-workers trials reported \nendoleak as an outcome. Across these RCTs, some form of \nendoleak occurred at varying frequencies (up to approximately \n20%) following EVAR. Type II endoleaks were most common, \nfollowed by type I. The cumulative rate of endoleaks in patients \nfrom the EUROSTAR registry was higher (32.5%). \n4.1.8 Only EVAR 1 reported on device migration following EVAR. In the \ntrial, 12 of 529 (2.3%) patients experienced device migration during \nfollow-up, of whom seven (1%) required re-intervention. \n4.1.9 The EVAR 1 and DREAM trials compared overall re-intervention \nrates between patients treated with EVAR and OSR. In DREAM, \nthe risk of re-intervention was significantly higher in the EVAR \ngroup for the first 9 months (hazard ratio 2.9; 95% CI 1.1 to 6.2, \np = 0.03) but the groups were not significantly different thereafter \n(hazard ratio 1.1; 95% CI 0.1 to 9.3, p = 0.95). At the medium-term \nfollow-up in EVAR 1, the hazard ratio for re-intervention was 2.7 \n(95% CI 1.8 to 4.1) indicating a higher risk in the EVAR group. The \n4-year point estimates for re-intervention in this trial were 20% for \nthe EVAR group compared with 6% for the OSR group. The \ncumulative rate of re-intervention in the EUROSTAR registry was \nsimilar to the 4-year point estimate for the EVAR group in EVAR 1. \n4.1.10 Only the trial by Cuypers and co-workers reported cardiac events: \nthree (5%) in the EVAR group and two (11%) in the OSR group. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 7  \n4.1.11 All four RCTs reported some details of health-related quality of life \n(HRQoL). All used the Medical Outcomes Study short form 36 (SF-\n36) questionnaire, but different components were reported, making \nit difficult to compare results across studies. Overall, data from \nthese trials suggested that there may be a short-term quality-of-life \nadvantage for EVAR patients compared with those who have OSR. \nLonger-term quality-of-life data tended to favour OSR. \nEVAR versus non-surgical management (patients with unruptured \naneurysms considered unfit for OSR) \n4.1.12 The Assessment Group identified one published RCT (EVAR 2, \nn = 338) that compared EVAR and non-surgical management in \npatients judged to be unfit for OSR. The Assessment Group \nconsidered the trial to be of high quality. The primary endpoint was \nall-cause mortality and secondary endpoints were aneurysm-\nrelated mortality, HRQoL, postoperative complications and hospital \ncosts. The trial found no differences in AAA-related and all-cause \nmortality outcomes between groups at medium term. However, this \nfinding cannot be taken as definitive because substantial numbers \nof patients randomised to non-surgical management crossed over \nto receive surgical repair of their aneurysm. \nAssessment of risk factors for adverse outcomes following EVAR \n4.1.13 The Assessment Group identified 32 studies investigating specific \nrisk factors for adverse outcomes after EVAR. The Assessment \nGroup stated that the studies did not provide definitive evidence but \nage, gender, renal impairment, fitness, American Society of \nAnesthesiologists (ASA) score and aneurysm size may be \npredictive of lower 30-day survival. There may be an association \nbetween fitness for the open procedure, aneurysm size and device \ntype and aneurysm-related mortality. Pulmonary status, renal \nimpairment, ASA score and aneurysm size might adversely affect \nall-cause mortality. The Assessment Group did not find any \nconsistent risk factors for re-intervention. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 8  \nSummary \n4.1.14 Compared with OSR, EVAR reduced operative mortality (OR 0.35; \n95% CI 0.19 to 0.73) and aneurysm-related mortality over the \nmedium term (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.83) but offered no \nsignificant difference in all-cause mortality at medium term. EVAR \nwas associated with an increased rate of complications and re-\ninterventions. There was limited RCT evidence comparing EVAR \nwith non-surgical management in patients unfit for OSR. Although \nthe EVAR 2 trial found no differences in mortality outcomes \nbetween groups this finding should not be taken as definitive. \n4.2 Cost effectiveness \nPublished literature \n4.2.1 The Assessment Group identified five economic evaluations that \nconsidered EVAR for patients with unruptured aneurysms, who \nneeded surgery and were considered fit for open surgery. All five \nwere cost?utility analyses. Two were based on EVAR programmes \nin the USA (Patel and co-workers and Bosch and co-workers), two \nwere based on EVAR programmes in the UK (Epstein and co-\nworkers and Michaels and co-workers) and one was based on an \nEVAR programme in the Netherlands (Prinssen and co-workers). \nThese economic evaluations showed conflicting results. Patel and \nco-workers estimated $9905 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) \ngained and Bosch and co-workers estimated $22,836 per QALY \ngained, whereas others (Epstein and co-workers and Prinssen and \nco-workers) estimated ?110,000 per QALY gained. Michaels and \nco-workers found that EVAR was dominated by OSR. \n4.2.2 The economic evaluation by Michaels and co-workers also \nconsidered EVAR for patients with unruptured aneurysms who \nwere considered unfit for OSR. This was based on effectiveness \nand resource data taken from EVAR 1, DREAM and a systematic \nreview of the literature. This evaluation resulted in an ICER of \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 9  \n?8579 per QALY gained for EVAR in patients who were unfit for \nOSR.  \n4.2.3 The EVAR 2 trial investigated whether EVAR improved survival \ncompared with no intervention in patients who were considered \nunfit for OSR. The Assessment Group stated that, although it was \nnot explicitly a cost-effectiveness study, it had been included in \ntheir cost-effectiveness review because the study reported life \nexpectancy and costs, and there have been no other cost-\neffectiveness analyses published in the light of the results of this \ntrial. The study found that EVAR did not improve HRQoL over the \nperiod, had a high 30-day operative mortality rate, had no 4-year \nsurvival benefit, and had considerably higher costs than the no-\nintervention arm. Therefore, in the patient group considered \n(approximately 76 years of age with AAA of roughly 6.5 cm in \ndiameter), it appeared that EVAR may be dominated by the no-\nintervention arm (that is, EVAR has higher costs and worse \noutcomes). \nManufacturer?s economic model \n4.2.4 Medtronic conducted a cost?utility analysis comparing EVAR with \nOSR in patients with an unruptured infra-renal AAA of at least \n5.5 cm in diameter who were considered fit for open surgery. The \naverage age of the population was 70 years and 90% of the \npatients were men. \n4.2.5 Medtronic developed a two-stage model to estimate the lifetime \ncosts and QALYs for EVAR and OSR in this patient population. The \nmodel comprised a decision tree for the first 30 days after surgery \nand then a Markov model from 30 days after surgery until death. At \nthe end of the first 30 days, patients in the EVAR arm entered one \nof four states: successful EVAR with no complications; EVAR with \ncomplications; conversion to open surgery; or death. Patients in the \nOSR arm entered one of three states: OSR with no complications; \nOSR with complications; or death. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 10  \n4.2.6 The effectiveness data used in the model, utility scores for health \nstates and resource use data, were largely drawn from EVAR 1 for \nOSR and supplemented with additional commercial-in-confidence \ndata. Utility scores for health states were taken directly from \nEVAR 1. These indicated that in the first 3 months after surgery, \npatients in the OSR arm had a slightly lower utility (0.67) than \npatients in the EVAR arm (0.73). From 24 months onwards it was \nassumed that utility was equal in both arms (although it was age \ndependent). Disutility scores for the systemic complications were \ndrawn from several sources. \n4.2.7 Data on mortality were obtained from a re-analysis of data from the \nEVAR 1 trial stratified by Customised Probability Index score for a \n4-year time period and split by AAA-related mortality and all-cause \nmortality. AAA-related mortality was defined as deaths within \n30 days of surgery for AAA as well as deaths for which the \nunderlying cause was attributable to ICD codes I713?19, ?all-cause \nmortality?. This term captured all causes of death and, if \nrandomisation had been properly conducted, any difference should \nonly have occurred with respect to mortality associated with the \nprocedure. \n4.2.8 For the base-case analysis from the Medtronic model, the ICER at \n30 years for this patient group, applying all-cause mortality rates, \nwas ?15,681 per QALY gained. The ICER was lower when the \nAAA-related mortality rate was applied with an ICER of ?11,339 per \nQALY gained. Secondary analysis demonstrated that, when \nextreme data points on length of stay were removed, the base-case \nICER was ?12,526 per QALY gained when applying all-cause \nmortality rates. \n4.2.9 Medtronic conducted univariate sensitivity analyses for all the \nparameters in the model, using the values for the lower and upper \nconfidence limits of each parameter. The manufacturer found that \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 11  \nthe ICER was most sensitive to the short-term relative risk of \noperative mortality.  \nAssessment Group model \n4.2.10 The Assessment Group?s economic evaluation was divided into two \nparts. The first part compared the cost effectiveness of EVAR with \nOSR in patients with large unruptured aneurysms (at least 5.5 cm \nin diameter) considered fit for OSR. This analysis assumed that the \ndecision to operate had already been taken. The second part of the \nAssessment Group?s economic evaluation estimated the cost \neffectiveness of treatment strategies that differed in when and how \nthe aneurysm repair for unruptured aneurysms should be carried \nout. In this second part, the Assessment Group compared surgery \n(EVAR or OSR) with no surgery or watchful waiting as alternative \ntreatment strategies. \n4.2.11 In the analyses for both parts of their economic evaluation, the \nAssessment Group initially stratified their results according to three \nkey patient characteristics: age, fitness (risk of operative mortality) \nand aneurysm size. Fitness in the model was represented by pre-\nexisting conditions such as cardiac, pulmonary or renal \ninsufficiency, which might predict operative mortality. The \nAssessment Group considered that because of the large number of \ncombinations of potential risk factors and levels it would be more \nconvenient to express fitness according to a single scale. In their \nanalysis, the Assessment Group defined four levels of fitness: good \nfitness or no pre-existing conditions affecting operative mortality; \nmoderate fitness, with twice the odds of operative mortality \ncompared with a person of the same age and aneurysm size with \ngood fitness; poor fitness, with four times the odds of operative \nmortality compared with a person of the same age and aneurysm \nsize with good fitness; and very poor fitness, with eight times the \nodds of operative mortality compared with a person of the same \nage and aneurysm size with good fitness. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 12  \nEVAR compared with OSR: methods \n4.2.12 The model compared OSR with EVAR in patients with a diagnosed \nAAA of at least 5.5 cm in diameter who were considered fit for \nOSR. The perspective of the model was that of the NHS. The time \nhorizon of the model was for the patient?s lifetime. All costs used \n2007 prices. Costs and health benefits in future years were \ndiscounted at a rate of 3.5% per year. The base-case model \nassumed that patients? age, fitness levels and aneurysm sizes at \nthe time of the decision to undertake surgery influenced baseline \nrisks, but that the effect of treatment on operative mortality (odds \nratio) of EVAR versus OSR was constant for all patient groups. \n4.2.13 Patients entered the model after the decision to operate had been \nmade, and had a primary aneurysm repair procedure (that is, either \nEVAR or OSR). Following this, patients could die, convert from \nEVAR to OSR, or survive the procedure. Survivors passed into a \nMarkov cohort model to estimate lifetime costs and QALYs. It was \nassumed that patients who converted from EVAR to OSR during \nthe primary admission had the same long-term prognosis as those \nwho had undergone OSR initially. \n4.2.14 For the analyses, the results were stratified by patient fitness, age \nand aneurysm diameter. Each variable affected the parameter \nestimates, which were calculated using risk equations for operative \nmortality after EVAR and OSR, the rate of non-aneurysm deaths \nmore than 30 days after aneurysm repair, the rate of late \naneurysm-related death and the rate of late readmission for \ncomplications. \n4.2.15 Costs were incurred in the model during the primary admission, in \nsurveillance after surgery and if the patient was readmitted to \nhospital for an aneurysm-related complication. The costs and \nresources used during the primary procedures were estimated from \nthe ITT analysis of EVAR 1. Resource use and costs for intensive \ncare during the primary procedure were based on the actual use of \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 13  \nICUs and high-dependency units (HDUs) as recorded in EVAR 1. \nAll patients undergoing EVAR, whether they experienced adverse \nevents or not, were assumed to require regular specialist hospital \noutpatient attendances and CT scans to monitor their aneurysm \nrepair. In the base case, based on the results of a survey of UK \nhospitals participating in the EVAR trials, the Assessment Group \nassumed that patients required two surveillance visits during the \nfirst year and one visit per year thereafter. Based on the findings of \nEVAR 1, the Assessment Group assumed that HRQoL declined by \n0.077 in the 6-month period following open surgery, by 0.027 \nfollowing EVAR and by 0.077 after readmission. Patients without \nthe need for re-intervention were assumed to recover to age- and \nsex-specific average population values of HRQoL 6 months after \nthe procedure. The utility values more than 6 months after \nsuccessful surgery were 0.78 for patients aged 75 years or younger \nand 0.75 for patients older than 75 years. \nEVAR compared with OSR: results \n4.2.16 The cost-effectiveness results for EVAR compared with OSR were \nstratified by age, aneurysm size and fitness at baseline. For \npatients of moderate fitness, with aneurysms larger than 7.5 cm in \ndiameter and aged older than 80 years, the cost-effectiveness \nestimate for EVAR was lower than ?20,000 per QALY gained. For \npatients of poor fitness, with aneurysms of 5.5?6.0 cm in diameter \nand aged 75 years and older, the cost-effectiveness estimates for \nEVAR were also lower than ?20,000 per QALY gained. The ICERs \nfor EVAR for patients of good fitness, with any size of aneurysm \nand of any age, were estimated to be either higher than ?30,000 \nper QALY gained or EVAR was dominated by OSR. \nImmediate elective surgery (EVAR or OSR) compared with watchful \nwaiting and no intervention: methods \n4.2.17 An exploratory analysis considered when surgery (with EVAR or \nOSR) might be cost effective, compared with no surgery or \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 14  \ndelaying the decision for patients at each age and aneurysm size. \nThe Assessment Group assumed that the patient was evaluated \nevery 6 months in the watchful waiting policy. The Assessment \nGroup also assumed that surveillance was stopped if a decision \nwas made to rule out surgery and there were no subsequent \nmonetary costs to the healthcare system. The costs of deferral \nwere the monitoring costs of CT scans and outpatient attendance, \ndeaths while waiting and a time preference for current benefits \nrather than future benefits. The Assessment Group assumed \npatients had normal HRQoL for their age while under surveillance, \nalthough it was recognised that evidence suggested that patients \nwith diagnosed untreated aneurysm suffer anxiety. \n4.2.18 A dynamic programme was constructed for this exploratory \nanalysis to evaluate EVAR versus OSR and an option of no \nsurgery. This estimated the net benefit of a watchful waiting \nstrategy, and calculated the optimum policy (EVAR, OSR, no \nsurgery or watchful waiting) for each aneurysm size and age. \nImmediate elective surgery (EVAR or OSR) compared with watchful \nwaiting and no intervention: results \n4.2.19 The base-case model (where EVAR was compared with OSR) \nestimated the ICERs for EVAR for patients of good fitness, with any \nsize of aneurysm and of any age, to be either over ?30,000 per \nQALY gained or EVAR was dominated by OSR. Including a \nwatchful waiting or no-surgery strategy did not alter these results. \n4.2.20 The following management strategies for patients of poor fitness \nwere predicted to have an ICER of less than ?20,000 per QALY \ngained: EVAR for aneurysm diameters of 5.5?7.4 cm and patients \naged 74?78 years; OSR for aneurysm diameters of 5.5?7.4 cm and \npatients younger than 74 years; no surgery or watchful waiting for \naneurysm diameters of 5.5?7.4 cm and patients older than \n78 years; and EVAR for aneurysm diameters of 7.5 cm or greater \nand patients aged 83 years or younger. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 15  \n4.2.21 The following management strategies for patients of very poor \nfitness were predicted to have an ICER of less than ?20,000 per \nQALY gained: EVAR for aneurysms of 5.5?7.4 cm in diameter and \npatients aged 74 years or younger; no surgery or watchful waiting \nfor aneurysms of 5.5?7.4 cm in diameter and patients older than \n74 years; and EVAR for aneurysm sizes of 7.5 cm or greater and \naged 78 years or younger. \n4.2.22 The Assessment Group identified the following uncertainties within \nthe model. The model comparing surgery with watchful waiting did \nnot use treatment effects from RCTs. This was because the \ncrossovers, delays and absence of a watchful waiting protocol in \nEVAR 2 made the results difficult to use directly to identify the most \ncost-effective form of management. Therefore, the Assessment \nGroup could not use treatment effects from this trial to inform the \nmodel. Instead, the natural history of patients with untreated infra-\nrenal aneurysms was estimated using rupture rates and growth \nrates obtained from a review of the literature, and compared with \noutcomes estimated by the model of EVAR and OSR for patients \nwith the same baseline characteristics. Given the uncertainties in \nthe data, and the potential for bias in this non-randomised \ncomparison, the Assessment Group intended their decision model \nand dynamic programme for watchful waiting to be exploratory. \nAssessment Group?s additional analyses: methods \n4.2.23 The Assessment Group undertook further analyses at the request \nof the Appraisal Committee. These analyses included a revised \nbase case in which fitness scores, age and gender were \naggregated to represent, as near as possible, an ?average? UK \npopulation that would be considered suitable for EVAR, and a \nhazard ratio for late AAA-related deaths with EVAR compared with \nOSR of 1.5. The Appraisal Committee also requested further \nsensitivity analyses including the following scenarios: a hazard ratio \nof late AAA-related deaths of 1.2; reduced rates of convergence of \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 16  \nthe survival curves after EVAR and OSR; the current range of \nprices of endovascular stents paid by the NHS in England and \nWales; and the relative cost of the procedures. \n4.2.24 In order to construct the revised base case based on an average \nUK population, the Assessment Group compared the mean age \nand aneurysm size and mortality of the patients in the EVAR 1 trial, \nRETA and EUROSTAR. On the basis of these sources and clinical \nopinion, it was thought that an operative mortality for EVAR of \napproximately 2% would be fairly representative of average UK \nclinical practice. The Assessment Group used the risk equation for \ncalculating operative mortality to indicate which population had an \noperative mortality similar to the estimate of the expected operative \nmortality of 2% after EVAR. The risk equation indicated that \npatients aged 75 years, with moderate fitness and an aneurysm of \n6.5 cm in diameter were predicted to have an operative mortality of \n2.1%. \n4.2.25 The original base case used a hazard ratio for late AAA-related \ndeaths of 2.46 (95% CI 0.48 to 12.7). The revised base case used \na hazard ratio of 1.5 over the entire model time horizon. Sensitivity \nanalyses explored the effect of a lower hazard ratio of 1.2, and a \ndeclining parameter value where the hazard ratio was 2.46 for the \nfirst 4 years and 1.0 thereafter.  \n4.2.26 The original model assumed an initial non-aneurysm mortality after \nEVAR until the cumulative rates of all-cause mortality were equal. \nThe original hazard ratio for excess mortality was 1.072, based on \nEVAR 1 trial data. In the additional analyses, the Assessment \nGroup varied the rate of excess late non-aneurysm mortality in a \nsensitivity analysis from 1 (no excess late mortality after EVAR) to \n1.144. \n4.2.27 The original base case used a hazard ratio of 6.7 for late re-\ninterventions for aneurysm-related complications for EVAR \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 17  \ncompared with OSR. In the revised analyses, the Assessment \nGroup undertook a sensitivity analysis using a lower hazard ratio of \nre-intervention of 1.5. \n4.2.28 The original base case used a cost for the EVAR procedure \n(including the cost of the device) of ?10,416 and for the open \nprocedure of ?9893, a difference of ?523. For the revised analyses, \nsample data were obtained from the NHS Purchasing and Supply \nAgency for NHS organisations in England for the mean price of an \nendovascular stent?graft. The price of endovascular stent?grafts \nused in the additional analyses was based on an average of ?5000 \n(irrespective of the number of components required). The \nAssessment Group also undertook sensitivity analyses where the \ncost of the EVAR procedure was ?1150 lower than in the original \nbase case (that is, EVAR and OSR had the same initial procedure \ncost). \n4.2.29 On the basis of a survey of hospitals, the original Assessment \nGroup model included two CT scans in the first year and one each \nyear thereafter. Because practice varied between centres, the \nAssessment Group undertook sensitivity analyses that considered \nlower annual costs, representing the use of cheaper technology \nsuch as duplex ultrasound and/or less frequent attendance. \n4.2.30 As in their original model, the Assessment Group also considered \npatients of good fitness and patients of moderate and poor fitness \nseparately. The Assessment Group defined good fitness here as \nthe absence of renal disease, an ASA score of I or II, and the \nsurgeon?s assessment that the patient was suitable for open \nsurgery. \nAssessment Group?s additional analyses: results \n4.2.31 The revised base case used patient characteristics set to the \naverage population, that is, age 75 years, moderate fitness, and an \naneurysm 6.5 cm in diameter. The ICER for the revised base case, \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 18  \nwith a hazard ratio for late AAA-related deaths with EVAR relative \nto OSR of 2.46, was ?121,725 per QALY gained. The ICER for the \nrevised base case, with a hazard ratio of late aneurysm deaths of \n1.5 for the lifetime of the patient, was approximately ?49,000 per \nQALY gained.  \n4.2.32 The model includes an initial excess hazard of late non-aneurysm \ndeath after EVAR until the survival curves converge at 3 years. In \nthe revised base case, if the excess hazard was set such that the \nsurvival curves converged at 8 years (with other parameters as the \nrevised base case), then the ICER was approximately ?22,000 per \nQALY gained. If the excess hazard was twice that of the base case, \nthe survival curves converged at 2 years and the ICER was \napproximately ?96,000 per QALY gained. \n4.2.33 The revised base case assumed that the hazard of late aneurysm \ndeath was 1.5 times greater after EVAR than after OSR, for the \nlifetime of the patient. If there was no difference between \ntreatments (hazard ratio 1.0) and all other parameters in the \nrevised base case remained the same, then the ICER was \napproximately ?29,000 per QALY gained. If the hazard ratio of late \naneurysm death was 1.2, the ICER was approximately ?37,000 per \nQALY gained.  \n4.2.34 The original base case in the assessment report assumed that the \nhazard ratio of late re-intervention was 6.7 for the lifetime of the \npatient, although the absolute rate of re-intervention declined over \ntime and was low (about 2% per year) 4 years after EVAR. In the \nrevised base case, if there was no difference between treatments \n(hazard ratio 1.0), the ICER was approximately ?27,000 per QALY \ngained. If the hazard ratio of late re-intervention was 1.5 (the same \nas that of late aneurysm death) the ICER was ?29,000 per QALY \ngained.  \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 19  \n4.2.35 The revised base case assumed that one follow-up with CT per \nyear was required after EVAR. If the cost per year was half that \nused in the revised base case (?54 per annum compared with \n?108), then the ICER was ?44,000 per QALY gained. If there were \nno follow-up visits in the revised base case (while re-interventions \nand aneurysm deaths were unchanged), the ICER was \napproximately ?39,000 per QALY gained. \n4.2.36 The revised base case assumed that the EVAR procedure cost \n?523 more than OSR. If it was assumed that the EVAR procedure \ncost ?623 less than OSR, the ICER was approximately ?21,000 per \nQALY gained. Alternatively, if it was assumed that the EVAR \nprocedure cost the same as OSR, the ICER was approximately \n?36,000 per QALY gained.  \n4.2.37 In a multivariate sensitivity analysis the values in the revised base \ncase were changed as follows: 1.5 for the hazard ratio of late re-\nintervention; the initial EVAR procedure cost the same as OSR; \nand the procedure costs of intervention and follow-up were ?54 per \nannum. The resulting ICER was approximately ?12,000 per QALY \ngained for all patients, ?71,000 per QALY gained for patients of \ngood fitness and ?9000 per QALY gained for patients of moderate \nand poor fitness.  \n4.3 Consideration of the evidence \n4.3.1 The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the \nclinical and cost effectiveness of endovascular stent?grafts for \nAAAs, having considered evidence on the nature of the condition \nand the value placed on the benefits of endovascular stent?grafts \nby people with AAAs, those who represent them, and clinical \nspecialists. It was also mindful of the need to take account of the \neffective use of NHS resources. \n4.3.2 The Committee considered the care pathway for people with infra-\nrenal AAAs and the potential place of endovascular stent?grafts in \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 20  \nsuch a pathway. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that \nEVAR is now routinely considered as part of the management of \ninfra-renal AAAs. The Committee recognised that to identify \npatients for whom EVAR was appropriate it is necessary to take \naccount not only of the size of the aneurysm but also of other \nfactors such as physiological measures of the person?s fitness for \nsurgery and aneurysm morphology, and patient choice. The \nCommittee heard from the clinical specialists that these factors are \nassessed on a case-by-case basis by a specialist clinician \nexperienced in the management of AAAs. The Committee \nconcluded that it was essential to determine the appropriateness of \nEVAR through assessment by a specialist clinician experienced in \nthe management of aortic aneurysms. \n4.3.3 The Committee examined the clinical-effectiveness evidence for \nEVAR for patients with unruptured infra-renal aneurysms for whom \nelective surgical repair was considered appropriate. The Committee \nnoted that the four RCTs and three registries identified showed that \nEVAR had benefits in terms of reduced rates of operative and \naneurysm-related mortality over the medium term. The Committee \nalso noted that EVAR offered no significant difference in all-cause \nmortality at medium term and was associated with increased rates \nof complications and re-interventions compared with OSR. The \nCommittee heard from the clinical specialists that the rates reported \nin the trials for long-term aneurysm-related death, complications \nand re-intervention following EVAR were higher than those seen \ncurrently in UK clinical practice. The Committee heard that these \ntrials used older stent?grafts, and that the technology has \nsignificantly improved since the RCTs were carried out. In addition, \nclinical expertise both in assessing patients? suitability for EVAR \nand in undertaking the procedure has improved with more \nwidespread use of the technology. The Committee was persuaded \nthat the benefits of EVAR compared with OSR in current UK clinical \npractice were likely to be greater than those seen in the RCTs. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 21  \n4.3.4 The Committee next considered whether there was any evidence of \ndifferences in the clinical effectiveness of the various types of \nendovascular stent?grafts available. It noted that only two of the \nfive endovascular stent?grafts had been compared head-to-head in \nRCTs and that these studies showed no statistically significant \ndifferences between the outcomes. The Committee heard from the \nclinical specialists that the different endovascular stent?grafts are \nclinically comparable and that, in practice, any of the endovascular \nstent?grafts would be used with the choice of device depending on \nfactors such as a patient?s anatomy and aneurysm morphology.  \n4.3.5 The Committee examined the economic modelling that had been \ncarried out for the appraisal. The Committee noted that in the \nAssessment Group?s original base-case analyses estimates of cost \neffectiveness were stratified by age, aneurysm size and fitness. \nThe clinical specialists agreed that the selection of a patient for \nEVAR depended on a number of factors such as age, aneurysm \nmorphology and fitness for surgery, but stated that there was no \naccepted definition of fitness for surgery and that this was usually a \nsubjective decision made by the surgeon. The Committee accepted \nthat because there were no universally accepted criteria for \nassessing operative risk for aneurysm surgery, the fitness and age \ncriteria used in the original Assessment Group?s economic model \ncould not be routinely reproduced in clinical practice. The \nCommittee concluded that it was not appropriate for the subgroups \nto be stratified as done in the original Assessment Group?s \neconomic model and therefore the estimates should be merged to \ntake account of the average UK population characteristics that \nwould be considered for EVAR.  \n4.3.6 The Committee considered the revised base case presented by the \nAssessment Group in which fitness scores and age were \naggregated to represent, as closely as possible, the average UK \npopulation that would be considered for EVAR. The Committee \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 22  \nnoted that following the revised base case the ICER for EVAR \ncompared with OSR was ?122,000 per QALY gained. \n4.3.7 The Committee then discussed the key parameters in the \nAssessment Group?s economic model. The Committee considered \nthe different approaches used for modelling the rate of \nconvergence of the survival curves after EVAR and OSR. The \nCommittee was aware that the rate of convergence of the survival \ncurves depended on the balance between operative mortality and \nexcess late non-aneurysm-related deaths. The Committee noted \nthat the Assessment Group?s model included input values for \nexcess late non-aneurysm mortality after EVAR in contrast to the \nmodel submitted by the manufacturer. The Committee heard from \nthe clinical specialists that most of the long-term non-aneurysm \nmortality seen in clinical practice was related to cardiovascular \ndisease. The Committee was aware that the value of 1.072 used by \nthe Assessment Group for long-term non-aneurysm mortality in \ntheir original base case had been obtained from the EVAR 1 trial. \nThe Committee was also aware that the Assessment Group had \nvaried the rate of excess late non-aneurysm mortality in their \nrevised sensitivity analyses from 1.0 to 1.144. The Committee \nnoted the effect of changing the values for excess non-aneurysm \nmortality after EVAR on the predicted convergence of the survival \ncurves. The Committee was persuaded that, although there was \nuncertainty about the value for excess non-aneurysm mortality after \nEVAR, the value of 1.072 used by the Assessment Group in both \ntheir original and revised base-case analyses was plausible and \nappropriate given the empirical data available.  \n4.3.8 The Committee considered the values used by the Assessment \nGroup and the manufacturer for the hazard ratio for late aneurysm-\nrelated deaths. The Committee noted that the hazard ratio used by \nthe Assessment Group in their original base case (hazard \nratio 2.46) was higher than that used by the manufacturer (hazard \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 23  \nratio 1.0). The Committee noted that the hazard ratio used by the \nAssessment Group was not statistically significant and was based \non a very small number of deaths. The clinical specialists agreed \nthat the rate of late aneurysm-related deaths seen in UK clinical \npractice was higher for those patients receiving EVAR compared \nwith OSR, but that the hazard ratio would be much lower than that \npresented by the Assessment Group. The Committee discussed \nthe range of possible values for the hazard ratio of late aneurysm-\nrelated deaths and their relevance to UK practice and concluded \nthat a hazard ratio of 1.5 was most appropriate. \n4.3.9 The Committee considered the hazard ratio used in the model for \nre-intervention after EVAR (6.7) and noted that the ratio used by \nthe Assessment Group had been obtained from the EVAR 1 trial. \nThe Committee heard from the clinical specialists that clinicians are \nless inclined to re-intervene in current UK clinical practice than was \nthe case during the RCTs. This was particularly true for type II \nendoleaks, which comprised the majority of re-interventions in the \ntrials. The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to use a \nhazard ratio for re-interventions of 1.5 in the revised cost-\neffectiveness analysis.  \n4.3.10 The Committee then considered the differential costs of the initial \nprocedures, either OSR or EVAR, which included operating theatre \ntime, intensive care and ward stay as well as the cost of the stent?\ngraft. The Committee noted that the resource use and costs for \noperating theatre time, intensive care and ward stay for EVAR used \nin the Assessment Group?s model were higher than those used in \nthe manufacturer?s model and that this difference in resource use \nwas due to slight differences in the estimates for length of stay in \noperating theatres, HDUs and ICUs. The Committee understood \nthat these differences were because the input costs in the \nAssessment Group?s economic model were based on the actual \ncosts and resources used in the EVAR 1 trial, whereas those in the \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 24  \nmanufacturer?s model had been derived from a number of other \nsources. The Committee was aware of the effect of the differing \nrelative costs on the cost-effectiveness estimates for EVAR from \nthe sensitivity analyses undertaken by the Assessment Group in \ntheir original and revised base cases. The Committee heard from \nthe clinical specialists that the length of stay in ICU and on the ward \nfollowing EVAR had reduced since the trials were undertaken. The \nCommittee was persuaded that the Assessment Group?s original \nand revised base cases may have overestimated length of stay in \nhospital following EVAR. The Committee concluded that there was \nuncertainty around the exact costs for theatre time and length of \nstay in HDU and ICU, and that this would have a large effect on the \ncost-effectiveness estimates for EVAR.  \n4.3.11 The Committee then considered the cost of the stent?grafts and \nheard from the clinical specialists that there were different \nprocurement arrangements available for purchasing endovascular \nstent?grafts and, as with many devices, no nationally agreed price \ncurrently exists. However, the Committee noted from additional \ninformation obtained from sample data that the current \nprocurement price for endovascular stent?grafts was on average \n?5000, irrespective of the number of components used. The \nCommittee therefore concluded, taking into account the total \nprocedural costs as discussed in section 4.3.10, that if the price of \nthe stent?graft was on average no more than ?5000 it was \nplausible to assume that there would be no difference in the initial \nprocedure cost between EVAR and OSR. \n4.3.12 The Committee also considered the costs of follow-up after EVAR. \nThe Committee noted that in their original base case the \nAssessment Group had included follow-up by CT scan whereas the \nmanufacturer had assumed that 50% of patients would receive \nfollow-up monitoring by CT and the remaining 50% would receive \nfollow-up monitoring by duplex ultrasound scan, to reflect changing \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 25  \nclinical practice in the UK. The Committee heard testimony from the \nclinical specialists that for patients undergoing EVAR, duplex \nultrasound scanning had largely replaced the need for CT. The \nCommittee was therefore persuaded that the cost of follow-up after \nEVAR may have been overestimated in the Assessment Group?s \noriginal and revised base cases. The Committee was persuaded \nthat although there was uncertainty about the costs of follow-up \nafter EVAR, the reduced costs (?54) used by the Assessment \nGroup in their sensitivity analyses on their revised base case \nrepresented a plausible estimate to use for the cost-effectiveness \nanalysis. \n4.3.13 The Committee agreed to use the following parameter values as \nthe basis for their discussions: \n? a hazard ratio for late aneurysm deaths of 1.5 \n? an excess non-aneurysm mortality after EVAR of 1.072 \n? a hazard ratio for late re-intervention of 1.5 \n? an annual cost of follow-up for EVAR of ?54 \n? no cost differential for EVAR and OSR for the initial procedure \n(where the average device cost is no greater than ?5000). \nThe Committee noted that the ICER for the treatment of an average \npatient (defined as a 75-year-old patient of moderate fitness with an \naneurysm of 6.5 cm diameter) with EVAR was ?12,000 per QALY \ngained. The Committee concluded, therefore, that endovascular \nstent?grafts are an appropriate use of NHS resources.  \n4.3.14 The Committee noted that the Assessment Group had undertaken \nfurther sensitivity analyses on the scenario described in 4.3.13 \nwhere ?moderate and poor fitness? and ?good fitness? rather than \n?the average patient? were used in the revised economic analyses. \nThe Committee noted that the ICERs for these two additional \nscenarios were ?9000 and ?71,000 per QALY gained based on \nQALY gains of 0.070 and 0.008 respectively for moderate and poor \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 26  \nfitness and good fitness. The Committee noted that the ICER \npresented by the Assessment Group for patients of good fitness \nsuggested that EVAR was not what would be usually agreed as a \ngood use of NHS resources in these patients. The Committee \nconsidered that the difference in QALYs between the different \nsubgroups was due to the absolute differences in operative \nmortality between EVAR and OSR for these patient groups. For the \nmoderate and poor fitness patients the operative mortality rate for \nEVAR and OSR was assumed in the model to be 4% and 11% \nrespectively. For the good fitness patients the operative mortality \nfor EVAR and OSR was assumed in the model to be 1% and 3% \nrespectively. The Committee was mindful that the relative \ndifferences in operative mortality were three times higher for OSR \ncompared to EVAR for both the good fitness and moderate and \npoor fitness patients. The Committee acknowledged that this lack \nof a difference in relative operative mortality between the fitness \nsubgroups would be part of the discussion between the clinician \nand patient during initial assessment of the appropriate choice of \nintervention. \n4.3.15 The Committee next considered how fitness for surgical \nintervention (EVAR or OSR) should be assessed. It heard from the \nclinical specialists and consultees that assessment of a patient?s \nfitness for surgical intervention for AAA involved assessment of the \nfollowing factors: pre-operative investigations, clinical opinion on \nthe suitability of OSR for an individual patient, overall life \nexpectancy, age, and aneurysm size and morphology. Comments \nreceived during consultation suggested that fitness for surgery \ncould be readily defined and therefore could form the basis for an \nappropriate distinction to be made between subgroups of patients \nwhich would be important to ensure a cost-effective use of \nresources. The Committee therefore reconsidered the Assessment \nGroup?s definitions of fitness as used in the economic model in \nrelation to whether they were clinically meaningful and could be \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 27  \nimplemented nationally. The Committee was also mindful that local \nprotocols existed between clinicians and commissioners on how to \nassess patients? fitness for surgery and that these assessments \nwere based on objective measures as well as clinical opinion. The \nCommittee agreed that clinicians? assessment of the \nappropriateness of open surgery would be decided on a case-by-\ncase basis. This would be reassessed at regular intervals based on \na number of factors, including general overall fitness for surgery as \nwell as aneurysm size and morphology. These factors could \nchange over time. The Committee was persuaded that, as there \nwere no nationally agreed definitions of fitness for surgery and no \nrelative difference in the risk of operative mortality for ?good fitness? \nand ?moderate and poor fitness? patients, it would be inappropriate \nto exclude a specific subgroup of patients because there was no \nclear distinction between the patient subgroups based on differing \nlevels of fitness. On this basis the Committee concluded that, \nalthough the cost-effectiveness estimate presented by the \nAssessment Group for patients of good fitness was higher than that \nnormally considered to be a good use of NHS resources, \nendovascular stent?grafts could be considered a cost-effective \ntreatment option for patients with unruptured infra-renal abdominal \naortic aneurysms, for whom surgical intervention (OSR or EVAR) is \nconsidered appropriate. The Committee agreed however, that the \ndecision on whether EVAR is preferred over OSR should be made \njointly between the patient and their clinician after assessment of a \nnumber of factors including aneurysm size and morphology, patient \nage, general life expectancy, fitness for open surgery, the short- \nand long-term benefits and risks of the procedures including \naneurysm-related mortality and operative mortality.  \n4.3.16 The Committee considered the treatment options for people who \nwere considered unfit for OSR, but could receive EVAR. It was \naware that the evidence base for EVAR in this situation was limited. \nThe Committee noted that the economic model submitted by the \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 28  \nAssessment Group explored the cost effectiveness of EVAR versus \nOSR including strategies of no intervention and watchful waiting. \nThe Committee was mindful of the limitations of the model \nhighlighted by the Assessment Group in the original assessment \nreport and their intention that the analysis was exploratory. The \nCommittee was also mindful that the cost-effectiveness estimates \nproduced by the Assessment Group in their revised analyses \napplied only to patients who were considered suitable for EVAR or \nOSR. The Committee noted that there were no revised cost-\neffectiveness estimates available for patients who were not suitable \nfor OSR (primarily patients with very high operative risk) that might \nstill be considered for EVAR. The Committee considered that given \ntheir conclusion that EVAR was a cost-effective treatment for \npatients of moderate and poor fitness based on the assumptions \ndescribed in sections 4.3.13 and 4.3.14, then it was plausible that \nthe cost-effectiveness estimate for EVAR for patients of very poor \nfitness would be similar. The Committee therefore concluded that \nEVAR would be an acceptable use of NHS resources in patients \nconsidered unfit for OSR in whom EVAR was considered \nappropriate.  \n4.3.17 The Committee was mindful that the data on the clinical \neffectiveness of EVAR came from trials and registries in which \npatients were treated predominantly by specialist clinicians working \nin units with significant annual throughput in terms of numbers of \npatients treated. The Committee considered whether such \noutcomes could be achieved in units with only developing expertise \nand lower annual patient numbers. The Committee heard from the \nclinical specialists that, in the UK, EVAR was undertaken in both \nspecialist and non-specialist units. The clinical specialists stated \nthat outcomes following EVAR were better for those patients \nundergoing the procedure in specialist units because of the higher \nnumbers of cases treated and therefore the increased clinical \nexpertise. The Committee reached the view that it was essential \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 29  \nthat EVAR be performed by clinicians experienced in the procedure \nand in the management of AAAs. The Committee therefore \nconcluded that EVAR using endovascular stent?grafts should only \nbe performed in specialist centres by clinical teams experienced in \nthe management of AAAs. The teams should have appropriate \nexpertise in all aspects of patient assessment and the use of \nendovascular aortic stent?grafts. \n4.3.18 The Committee examined the clinical effectiveness of EVAR for \nruptured aneurysms and was mindful of the limited published data. \nThe Committee noted that no estimate of cost effectiveness had \nbeen provided by the Assessment Group or the manufacturers. The \nCommittee heard from the clinical specialists that EVAR was used \nin UK clinical practice as a treatment option for patients with \nruptured aneurysms. The Committee considered that the collection \nof more data on the clinical effectiveness of EVAR for ruptured \naneurysms would enable a more precise estimate of the clinical \nand cost effectiveness of EVAR compared with OSR. Given the \ndifficulties of conducting RCTs, the Committee considered that data \nshould be collected through existing established registries and that \nall clinicians undertaking EVAR as a treatment for patients with \nruptured aneurysms should (with their patient?s consent) register \nthe patient with an existing registry in the UK. The Committee \nconcluded that given the possible benefits of EVAR for ruptured \naneurysms, and the feasibility of further registry data being \ncollected, a recommendation for use only in research would be \nappropriate where patients are enrolled into existing registries.  \n5 Implementation  \n5.1 The Healthcare Commission assesses the performance of NHS \norganisations in meeting core and developmental standards set by \nthe Department of Health in ?Standards for better health? issued in \nJuly 2004. The Secretary of State has directed that the NHS \nprovides funding and resources for medicines and treatments that \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 30  \nhave been recommended by NICE technology appraisals normally \nwithin 3 months from the date that NICE publishes the guidance. \nCore standard C5 states that healthcare organisations should \nensure they conform to NICE technology appraisals. \n5.2 'Healthcare standards for Wales? was issued by the Welsh \nAssembly Government in May 2005 and provides a framework both \nfor self-assessment by healthcare organisations and for external \nreview and investigation by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales. \nStandard 12a requires healthcare organisations to ensure that \npatients and service users are provided with effective treatment \nand care that conforms to NICE technology appraisal guidance. \nThe Assembly Minister for Health and Social Services issued a \nDirection in October 2003 that requires local health boards and \nNHS trusts to make funding available to enable the implementation \nof NICE technology appraisal guidance, normally within 3 months. \n5.3 NICE has developed tools to help organisations implement this \nguidance (listed below). These are available on our website \n(www.nice.org.uk/TA167).  \n? A costing statement explaining the resource impact of this \nguidance. \n? Audit support for monitoring local practice. \n6 Recommendations for further research \n6.1 The following trials are currently ongoing. \n? The Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm trial ACE is a French \nRCT comparing EVAR and OSR in patients aged 50 years and \nolder with an AAA measuring 5 cm or more in diameter (4 cm or \nmore if rapidly growing). The trial started in January 2003 with \nan expected completion date of January 2006. The date of \npublication has not been confirmed at present.  \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 31  \n? The Amsterdam acute aneurysm trial is an RCT comparing \nEVAR and OSR in patients with a ruptured AAA. The trial was \nexpected to end in August 2008. \n? OVER (open surgery versus endovascular repair) is a large USA \nRCT comparing EVAR and OSR in patients aged 50 years and \nolder with an AAA measuring 5 cm or more in diameter (4.5 cm \nor more if rapidly growing). The expected completion date is \nOctober 2011. \n? CAESAR (comparison of surveillance versus aortic endografting \nfor small aneurysm repair) is an RCT in Italy to compare EVAR \nwith surveillance (and eventual treatment) in patients with AAAs \nof diameter 4.1?5.4 cm who are suitable for EVAR. Results are \nexpected at the end of 2011. \n6.2 Further research is needed on the management of ruptured \naneurysms. Given the difficulties of conducting RCTs on the \nmanagement of ruptured aneurysms, the collection of data through \nexisting, established registries, particularly RETA (for EVAR) and \nNVD (for OSR) in the UK should be continued. \n6.3 Research is required to measure the extent to which the relative \ntreatment effect of EVAR on operative mortality can be assumed \nconstant across subgroups of patients. \n6.4 Research is required into how to incorporate the best available risk-\nscoring systems for the management of AAA into decision-making \nin routine clinical practice. \nNICE technology appraisal guidance 167 32  \n7 Related NICE guidance \nPublished \nLaparoscopic repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

          "Introduction:  London and the Camden Town Group\nIntroduction:  London and the Camden Town Group\n\n\nSteven Barfield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<1>\n\nThis section of the Literary London journal presents materials arising from the symposium Metropolis and Modernity: Modern Painters, 12 April 2008, organized by the University of Westminster and Tate Britain and which accompanied the exhibition Modern Painters: The Camden Town Group, (Tate Britain  13 February -- 5 May 2008). Alan Morrison of the University of Westminster's London Studies Programme and Sylvia Lahav and Silaja Suntharalingam from Tate co-organised the event.\n\n\n\n\n<2>\n\nThe symposium was intended to explore the importance of the frequently overlooked painters of the Camden Town Group and their role in the remaking of aesthetic representations of London, how their own styles and the accompanying debates about these relate to the practices of European artistic modernism, and the connection of their work to the new urban themes that had become increasingly important as ways of viewing the city. The group itself included primarily painters: Walter Richard Sickert, Robert Bevan, Spencer Gore, Charles Ginner and Harold Gilman. Of these, perhaps only Sickert is still well known by the more general public, it his role in the group as a whole that remains both significant and controversial.\n\n\n\n\n<3>\n\nAnne Witchard begins the section with a lengthy and evaluative review of the Tate exhibition, focusing in particular on what it meant for those working on Literary London in the specific period of the early twentieth-century. She follows the exhibition in terms of the way it was organised thematically, while suggesting useful links between the artists' own agendas as a loose-knit group and that of their literary counterparts in the period. As Witchard adroitly remarks: ?one of the strengths of the Tate's presentation of these works lay in the treatment of the paintings as social history, grouping them as images which capture the period scene ... an  engagement with the subject of modern life and the privileged aspect it gives us on this most compelling moment in London's history?. This is not to say that these art works do not function as aesthetic interventions within newly emerging conventions of the representations of the city as modernist topos and it is the various debates and differing attitudes towards how London should be best depicted whose significance and value is charted by the two subsequent essays in this section.  \n\n\n\n\n<4>\n\nArt historian Bernard Vere examines the work of the painters in terms of their somewhat ambivalent relationship to the means by which the rapidly changing metropolis might best be represented in art, suggesting the dynamic and dialectical relationship between the modernity of the city and the debate over how it should be depicted. His aim is to restore the Camden Town Group from the marginalised position they have been given by subsequent art historians. Vere thus pursues how their artistic practices and subjects relate to debate in terms of:  ?a London that between 1911 and 1913 was pervaded by Post-Impressionism, Italian Futurism, Cubism and Expressionism and [by] ... other competing factions within the English art scene?. In Vere?s richly historicised reading of the Camden Town Group's internal tensions, the artists? relationship to continental European work and their attitudes towards art and its 'proper' subject matter, he does much to make us understand how at the time British critics glimpsed something potentially radical and unnerving about the Camden Town Group's work and ethos. Historically the Camden Town Group's fate was to be eclipsed by Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism and the London vogue for Italian futurism (Marinetti's famous remark that London was ?the most Futurist city in Europe?  both generously appropriates and compliments Britain's capital as emblem of twentieth-century modernity); yet as Vere points out, such a reading with a hindsight does not do justice to the important moment of London's self-conscious modernity that is engaged with by the work of this group of painters.\n\n\n\n\n<5>\n\nAlan Munton, of the Wyndham Lewis society, takes a different and complementary tack to the question of the Camden Town Group within their specific moment in London's cultural history by revisiting and subsequently revising their relationship with Britain's most notorious modernist artist and man of letters, Percy Wyndham Lewis, the progenitor of the ?Great London Vortex?. Munton's argument emphasises the radicality of some members of the group from the contemporary point of view of Lewis himself, suggesting that Lewis was less in opposition to the group than he was at odds with Sickert?s own dislike of avant-garde painting. Munton argues that we should not underestimate the importance of  debates between Lewis and Sickert regarding the nature of whether art should be realist or not and what realism subsequently meant and the consequences of this for modernist painting. Such debates were frequently punctuated by Lewis' dry humour, but they also show the real contestation of critical principles that was at stake: ?Mr. Sickert?s description of my painting ?Creation? [is] a deliberate misstatement and invention?. For Lewis, Sickert is frequently and simply wrong, as well as prone to journalistic hyperbole in his attacks on modernist art such as that of Lewis and Epstein. Munton goes on to analyse Lewis' own depictions of London and other cityscapes within the contexts of his debates with Sickert, and these painting show how Lewis' sense of the importance of abstraction within art gestures towards the evolution of the newly evolving architecture of the city, to how people interact with one another in the spaces and to the relationships between people and their city opened up by the new technologies. We are grateful to Alan Munton for arranging permission to reproduce pictures from the estate of Mrs G.A. Wyndham Lewis for this issue of the journal. \n\n\n\n\n<6>   \n\nFinally, we asked a photographer, Joseph Waller, to revisit four of the paintings from the exhibition and to see how the original subjects of the painting may have changed. The resulting photographs say something about how London has and has not changed over the past century or so.\n\n\n",

This ânewâ technique is called Chi Walking (with a Chi Running offshoot).\n\nWhat I find interesting about this idea, is how even the most basic  of human activities can be re-invented and turned intoÂ  a commercial  product or service.\n\nAs one of the videos explains, when we are children we run by leaning forward, but by the time we are adults we have unlearned the natural way to move.\n\nSo you can now buy a range of books, âfive-fingerâ shoes, or join classes to re-learn from the experts how to walk or run properly.\n\nI am aware than many runners do get injuries from their activities, especially road running, but my scepticism is still high on whether this whole thing is some kind of Snake oil charm. Try watching this video of Master Stephen Hwaâs Tai Chi Walk Lesson, and see what you think.\n\nHowever, I am prepared to try pretty much anything reasonable that  might aid my path to top of the highest mountain in Africa, so will try  it for a while.\n\nAlthough my climb was not planned to raise money for charity (more to  prove Iâm not quite over the hill yet), quite a few people have asked  if they can sponsor me. So I have created a JustGiving page with a choice of charities to donate to if you would like to contribute.\n\nWhat is Chi?\n http://www.chiwalking.com/what-is-chiwalking/what-is-chi/\n\nMaster George Xu, our Tâai Chi teacher, asks us to focus on our  dantien, our center and to allow all movement toÂ  come from that place.  The energy moves from the center into the body and into theÂ  limbs to  create movement. Why? Because Chi is stronger than muscles, and movement  that comes from Chi is more deeply powerful. \n\nMore powerful than muscles? In the West, muscles are almost akin  to a god the way we worship them and what they represent. Covers of  magazines and TV commercials extol rock hard abs and buns of steel. What  is stronger than rock and steel?\n\nIn Tâai Chi we quickly learn that muscles are no match for the  power of Chi. Like the flow of water that created the Grand Canyon the  power of Chi takes you much further and faster than vulnerable muscles  whose duration is very short lived.\n\nYour dantien is the best home for your Chi and the best place for  you to focus your energy so that you can come from a balanced, whole  place in yourself. Your dantien is just below your navel and a few  inches in toward your spine. In Chi Running, Chi Walking and Chi Living  we encourage all movement, all action, all choices to come from this  center, that deep place in yourself that is home to your greatest  potential and power.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by Neil Infield on 22 June 2011 at 12:15 PM in Entrepreneurship, Science, Sports, Travel, work/life  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tTrackBack\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTrackBack URL for this entry:\nhttp://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341c464853ef0154332dea74970c\n\n\t\t\tListed below are links to weblogs that reference Will falling forward get me to the top of Kilimanjaro?:\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\t\n\t\tComments\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n                \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\t\n\n    \t\n\n\t\n\n    \n        \n\tVerify your Comment\n\n    Previewing your Comment\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by: \n\t\t\t\tÂ |Â \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n    This is only a preview.

The drug is generally well tolerated, concerns regarding aplastic anaemia is mainly extrapolated from oral data and therefore unlikely to be relevant.\n\tRecently several 4-quinolone eye drop preparations have become available. It would seem prudent to reserve these antibiotics for cases which specifically require these agents.\n\tFusidic acid is useful for staphylococcal infections.\n\tMany antibiotic preparations also incorporate a corticosteroid, these products should NOT be used unless the patient is under specialist supervision. They should not be used for undiagnosed ?red eye? which may be due to herpes simplex virus.\n\n\t?Recommended drugs\n\t?\n????????Chloramphenicol eye drops or eye ointment\n????????Fusidic acid (Fucithalmic) eye drops\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4 Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory preparations\n\n\n11.4.1 Corticosteroids\n\nGeneral Guidance\n\n\tCorticosteroids administered locally or systemically have an important role to play in the treatment of anterior segment inflammation.\n\tTopical corticosteroids should usually only be used under expert supervision.\n\tUse in ?red eye? with unconfirmed diagnosis is potentially hazardous since this may be due to herpes simplex virus infection in which case corticosteroid would aggravate the condition and could result in corneal ulceration.

          "Thames Valley Priorities CommitteesSouth Central Priorities Committees \n(Milton Keynes, Oxfordshire, Berkshire East, Berkshire West, Buckinghamshire PCTs) \n \nPolicy Statement 3: Bendamustine in the treatment of relapsed or refractory \nnon-Hodgkin?s lymphoma \n \nDate of issue:   April 2010 \n  \nThe Milton Keynes, Oxfordshire, Berkshire & Buckinghamshire Priorities Committee has \nconsidered the evidence for the use of Bendamustine in the treatment of relapsed or \nrefractory non-Hodgkin?s lymphoma and recommends that it should be LOW PRIORITY, \nbecause of lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness.  \n \nThe non-Hodgkin?s lymphomas (NHL) are a clinically and biologically diverse group of malignant \ndiseases where the proliferating cell type is lymphoid. Some forms of NHL are indolent (low-\ngrade) where life-expectancy is usually in the order of years but there is little prospect of cure; \nwhereas others are more aggressive (high-grade) with shorter untreated life-expectancy (but \nparadoxically having some prospect of cure) and requiring much more intensive treatment. For \nmost patients, treatment involves a number of different courses of chemotherapy leading to \ndisease remissions or responses of variable duration.  \n \nBendamustine is an alkylating agent that has been in use in Eastern Europe for over 30 years, \nbut only actively researched since the early 1990s. It appears to have little cross-resistance with \nother alkylating agents and therefore has a theoretical advantage in patients whose disease is \nalready refractory to, or has relapsed following treatment with other alkylating agents.  \n \nAt the time of this review, bendamustine is not licensed for use in the UK, although it is being \nmade available without cost on a compassionate basis.  \n \nThe evidence of clinical effectiveness for the use of bendamustine in relapsed or refractory NHL \nis limited by the lack of comparative studies. The small single arm non-randomised studies that \nhave been identified did not even have matched historical controls. There is no published \nevidence for cost-effectiveness.  \n \nBendamustine is currently being scoped on the NICE work programme. It is not known whether \nit will proceed to a technology appraisal. \nNOTES: \n1. Exceptional circumstances may be considered where there is evidence of significant health impairment and there is also \nevidence of the intervention improving health status. \n2. This policy will be reviewed in the light of new evidence or guidance from NICE.  \n \n \n",

A Strategic teenage pregnancy steering group to be set up which should \nensure the development of a clear strategy for service provision and \nIsle of Wight Primary Care Trust \nProfessional Executive Committee  1 September 2009                                                                                                                \n \nsupport. \n? An outreach contraceptive nurse is now in post. \n? There has been a drop in under 16s opting for termination. \n? There are 4 under 25 clinics now set up. \n? Chlamydia screening rates need to improve. \n? Where practices have a named lead the results are improved. \n? Drop in at college every week in an effort to catch the young people for \nChlamydia screening. \n \nThe Professional Executive Committee received the report on Teenage \nPregnancy. \n   \n09/93 IMMUNISATION AND VACCINATION ACTION PLAN  \n Paul Bingham presented the Immunisation and Vaccination Action Plan needed as  \nthis is now on the risk register there are issues around girls not wanting to be  \nvaccinated by School Nurses so would need to be immunised by their GP practice.  \n  \nHPV Catch up was poor.  One school was refusing to give out any information of  \nvaccination and it was suggested that the PCT could use its powers to go to the  \nEducation Department of the Council.  It was also suggested that information could  \nbe cascaded through faith groups.  \n  \nIt was suggested that education was important giving a more positive view on  \nimmunisation at the ante natal stage.  \n  \nSeasonal Flu H1N1 vaccinations were discussed and the use of community  \npharmacies as vaccinators.  It was suggested that the update of seasonal flu  \nwould be greater this year.  \n  \nIssues with the Child Health computer have not been resolved.  Greater clarity is  \nneeded on what the information flows are, where the process is defective, and who  \nis taking this forward.  \n  \nAn update is to be brought to the next PEC meeting.  PB \n \n   \n09/94 HAMPSHIRE DATA REPOSITORY  \n JS presented to PEC the paper on the Hampshire Data Repository.  There are  \nthree main options to consider:  \n  \n? Extraction of data from GP and hospital systems on a regular basis  \n \n(possibly using Miquest queries) and direct importation to the analytical \ndatabase, bypassing the clinical HHR.  \n \n? Extraction from the GP systems daily to the clinical HHR with the normal \n \nGraphnet extract, but with a facility for practices who do not want their \n \npatient data to be visible in the clinical HHR to put all of their records into \n \nquarantine.  This prevents access to the records, but permits their including \n \nin a pseudonymised form in the analysis database. \n \n? Extraction from the GP systems daily to the Clinical HHR with the normal \n \nGraphnet extract, but without the facility to put all patients from specific \n \npractices into quarantine. \n \n \n \nIt was agreed that MPC would be the forum for this and it should go to the next \n \nmeeting in October.  It was suggested that Hugh Sanderson and/or his colleagues \nJS \nshould attend a future meeting.  JS to liaise with PC. \n \n \n \n09/95 SOUTHAMPTON NHS TREATMENT CENTRE \n Paula Friend and two colleagues from Southampton NHS Treatment Centre (Care  \nIsle of Wight Primary Care Trust \nProfessional Executive Committee  1 September 2009                                                                                                                \n \nUK) attended the meeting to inform PEC about the Services that the Treatment \nCentre offered.  Their objective was to provide a shorter waiting time and ensure \nthat patients see everybody handling their care at one appointment slot.  PEC was \ninformed that they have contracts with 4 PCTs and IOW was a small percentage of \nthat contract.  Care UK were now looking at ways that they could help users from \nthe Island to use the services and one way they are now looking at is to pay fares \nfor the patient and the helper. \n \nThere was discussions and it was felt that: \n? Patients would like the names of clinicians \n? GPs would like a brochure for surgeries setting out specialities how to \ncontact the centre and names of surgeons. \n? A detailed information pack is in the process of being drafted. \n \nGeorge Thomson agreed to be a link with the Centre. \n   \n09/96 DVT TREATMENT PATHWAYS  \n Robin Beal and Ma?en Al-Mrayat are still to discuss the new National Policy. Peter RB/ \nColeman requested that an agreed local pathway is urgently needed. MAM \n   \n09/97 WCC ? PROCESS FOR 2009  \n JS informed the meeting that this year?s guidance is more challenging and more  \ndetailed.  The Strategy is to be delivered in early January.  \n  \nA meeting to clarify priorities will be held at the end of September.  \n \n   \n09/98 JSNA - UPDATE  \n PB updated the meeting that data collection was already computerised and that  \ndata would be published on the website.  \n \n   \n09/99 SHIP AND CATEGORY MANAGEMENT - UPDATE  \n Eleanor Roddick gave an update on the SHIP Category Management (CM) &  \nProvider Relationship Management (PRM) proposals.  The agreed pathways are \nStroke, Dementia, ENT, Cancer and Dentistry at a collaborative level which map in \ngeneral to the PCTs Transforming Community Services priorities; Stroke, \nDementia, End of Life Dentistry and CAMHS.  A Business Case is being prepared \nfor both the CM and PRM which will be presented at the SHIP board on 3rd \nSeptember setting out how the collaborative arrangements will operate. \n \n   \n09/100 POLICY STATEMENTS FOR LOW PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS  \n PS42 ? Polysomnography in the investigation of children with sleep-related  \ndisorders \nThere was discussion regarding the Policy Statement and it was agreed that if \npeople did present with the conditions listed they would be investigated, just not \nreferred for polysomnography. \n \nPS43 ? Rituximab therapy for refractory autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or \nidiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura \n \nThe Professional Executive Committee received the Policy Statements for \nLow Priority Interventions and recommended them to the Board. \n   \n09/101 SUSTAINABILITY UPDATE  \n The work of the Group has moved into a new phase where each of the eight  \nworkstreams agreed previously are now being led by one or more clinicians. The \nprocess over the next two weeks will be for each of those leaders to ascertain: \nIsle of Wight Primary Care Trust \nProfessional Executive Committee  1 September 2009                                                                                                                \n \n?

As perhaps expected, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia \nwere more common in those receiving insulin glargine. This is consistent with current \nNICE guidance on type 2 diabetes which recommends using appropriate stepped care with \npatients to manage their diabetes, using NPH (isophane) insulin as first choice in those \nwho require insulin. \n \nOverview and current advice: \nThe management of patients with type 2 diabetes is complex, requiring an individualised \nmultifactorial approach. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in people \nwith type 2 diabetes and treatments would ideally show a reduction in this risk. With regard to \nblood glucose control, NICE clinical guideline 87 on type 2 diabetes recommends metformin, a \nsulfonylurea and human NPH (isophane) insulin e.g. Insulatard, Humulin I or Insuman Basal as \n1\nthe preferred hypoglycaemic drugs . A long-acting insulin analogue can be considered as an \nalternative to human NPH (isophane) insulin in particular patients, such as those who require \nassistance from a carer or healthcare professional to administer their insulin injections, or those \nwith problematic hypoglycaemia. \nThe NICE Clinical Guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes is currently being updated \nalthough the publication date for this update is to be confirmed. \n \nNew evidence: \nORIGIN, a large randomised controlled trial (RCT), was carried out to see whether the long-acting \ninsulin analogue, insulin glargine, has cardiovascular benefits over standard care in people with \nimpaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or early type 2 diabetes who also had \n2\ncardiovascular risk factors . 12,537 people were randomised to basal insulin glargine or standard \ncare for a median of 6.2 years. In the glargine group, patients added an evening injection to their \nglycaemic-control regimen and titrated the dose to achieve a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.3 \nmmol/l or less. Patients in the standard care group were treated using clinical judgement, which \ninvolved minimal insulin use (0% insulin use at baseline, rising to 11.4% by year 7). \n \nORIGIN found the early use of basal insulin glargine had no effect on cardiovascular outcomes \ncompared with standard care. The rate of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or \nnon-fatal stroke was 2.94 per 100 patient-years in the insulin glargine group and 2.85 per 100 \npatient-years in the standard care group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.11, p=0.63). Similarly, there was no benefit from insulin glargine on this composite \noutcome plus revascularisation or heart failure (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11); or on all-cause \nmortality (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08) or microvascular outcomes (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to \n1.05). Compared with standard care, insulin glargine also had no effect on any cancer (HR 1.00, \n95% CI 0.88 to 1.13) or death from cancer (HR 0.94, 95% 0.77 to 1.15). \n \nInsulin glargine did reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or \nimpaired glucose tolerance at baseline. However, it was also associated with weight gain and \nmore episodes of hypoglycaemia. Patients in the glargine group gained a median of 1.6 kg and \nthose in the standard care group lost a median of 0.5 kg during follow-up. The incidence of a first \nepisode of severe hypoglycaemia was 1.00 per 100 patient-years with insulin glargine and 0.31 \nper 100 patient-years with standard care (p<0.001). \n \nSee the NHS Evidence topic page on type 2 diabetes for a general overview of the condition. The \nNICE Pathway: diabetes brings together all related NICE guidance and associated products on \nthe condition in a set of interactive topic-based diagrams. \n \n \nCommentary provided by Dr George Oswald* MD FRCP, Consultant Physician, Princess \nElizabeth Hospital, Guernsey: \nIn this RCT, early use of basal insulin glargine had no effect on cardiovascular outcomes but did \nincrease the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes compared with standard care. Insulin \nglargine was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk. However, treatments for type \n2 diabetes would ideally show a reduction in cardiovascular risk, not simply an improvement in \nsurrogate markers (e.g. HbA1c levels).  \n  \nOne of the main limitations with this study was the early use of insulin, which is not recommended \nin UK guidelines. NICE clinical guideline 87 recommends metformin, then metformin plus a \nsulfonylurea if blood glucose control remains inadequate (HbA1c above 6.5% [48 mmol/mol] or \nother higher agreed level). Human NPH (isophane) insulin is then recommended as the preferred \nthird-line option if a person is still markedly hyperglycaemic on dual therapy (HbA1c above 7.5% \n[59 mmol/mol] or other higher agreed level). In ORIGIN, insulin glargine was given to people very \nearly in treatment; 12% of people did not yet have diabetes (but had impaired fasting glucose or \nimpaired glucose tolerance) and 6% had a new diagnosis of diabetes. At baseline, the median \nHbA1c was just 6.4%, and 41% of participants were not yet using metformin, a sulfonylurea or \nother oral hypoglycaemic drug. \n \nThe study is potentially useful for highlighting any differences between early insulin use and no \ninsulin use, as a large difference in insulin therapy was maintained between groups. However, it \nwas not designed to test intensive versus conventional blood glucose control, and there was \nactually little difference observed between the groups in terms of glycaemic control. At 2 years, \nmedian HbA1c levels were 6.0% with insulin glargine and 6.3% with standard care. At 6 years, \nthese levels were 6.3% and 6.5%, respectively. \n \nThe ORIGIN trial used insulin glargine, not NPH (isophane) insulin which is the preferred first-\nchoice insulin recommended by NICE. For most people with type 2 diabetes, long-acting insulin \nanalogues, such as insulin glargine, offer no significant advantage over human NPH (isophane) \n3\ninsulin and are much more expensive . The main benefits of long-acting insulin analogues over \nNPH insulin relate to lower rates of hypoglycaemia, and once daily use. However, these potential \n3\nbenefits need to be balanced against their much higher costs . A health economic analysis by \n4\nNICE found that the cost-effectiveness of long-acting insulin analogues was not favourable . The \nincremental cost per QALY (compared with conventional insulin) was greater than ?100,000 in all \nscenarios, and in some scenarios in excess of ?400,000. It is more cost-effective to target use of \nlong-acting insulin analogues to those people with type 2 diabetes who would be most likely to \nbenefit. Hence, NICE clinical guideline 87 recommends long-acting insulin analogues can be \nconsidered as an alternative to human NPH (isophane) insulin in particular patients, such as those who require assistance from a carer or healthcare professional to administer their insulin \ninjections, or those with problematic hypoglycaemia. \n \n* Dr Oswald became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1990, is on the Specialist \nRegister of the GMC and is a member of the British Diabetes UKic Association, the Association of \nBritish Clinical Diabetologists Society, and the Wessex Diabetic Endocrine Association, and the \nIntensive Care Society. \n \n \nReferences \n \n1.
